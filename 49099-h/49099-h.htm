<h2>WHAT I FOUND OUT IN THE HOUSE
OF A GERMAN PRINCE</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Stories of Intimate Talks with the Hohenzollerns</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by an English-American Governess</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>These true stories reveal for the first time the "inside workings"
of the German Court. They are told by a woman who overheard
conversations between the members of the House of Hohenzollern
and the military and diplomatic castes. She was governess
in a German princely house at the outbreak of the war,
having secured her position through Prince Henry of Prussia,
whom she met in Washington, during his visit to the United
States. Her grandfather was an admiral in the United States
Navy. She tells frankly of her conversations with the Kaiser,
the Crown Prince, General von Bernhardi, the Krupps, Count
Zeppelin, General von Kluck, Herr Dernburg, and important
secret service people, who took her into their confidences.
These revelations (which have been published by <i>Frederick A.
Stokes Co.</i>, of New York) are most absorbing reading. Here
we are necessarily limited to a selection of but six anecdotes
from the hundreds of entrancing stories in her book. The book
is a valuable record of her experiences as governess of two
young princes at their game, "destroying London before supper,"
to her final escape in disguise after the war began.</p></blockquote>


<p>By a coincidence, it was five years ago, on the day
of my internment in a German castle last August
(1914), that I undertook to teach English and other
things to the children of that castle's owner. During
four of those years I did my duty to my three little
charges as well as I knew how. For the rest of
the time, up to two days before the declaration of
war between France and Germany, my conduct may
have been questionable: but that was because I put
duty to my country ahead of duty to the family of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
German prince. They were my employers; they
trusted me, and I am not sure whether I decided rightly
or wrongly. All I know is that I would do the same if
I had to live through the experience again....</p>

<p>As for the most important men who visited them, it
is different. I owe those persons nothing, and see no
reason for disguising their names. Most of them
have now, of their own accord, thrown off their peace-masks,
and revealed themselves as enemies of England,
if not of humanity, outside German "kultur."
What I have to tell will but show how long they have
held their present sentiments....</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
I&mdash;A CONVERSATION WITH THE KAISER</p>

<p>My two Princes and their cousin were having an
English lesson with me in a summer-house close to
their earthworks. It had been raining.</p>

<p>I was reading aloud a boys' book by George Henty
which I had brought among others from England for
that purpose, and stopping at exciting parts to get
the children to criticize it in English. We were having
an animated discussion, and all three were clamoring
for me to "go on&mdash;go on!" when I heard footsteps
crunching on the gravel path which led to the summer-house.
I did not look up, because I thought it might
be Lieutenant von X&mdash;&mdash; who was coming, and my
charges were too much excited to pay attention. But
presently I realized that the crunching had ceased,
close to us. My back was half turned to the doorway,
and before beginning to read again, I looked
round rather impatiently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>Two gentlemen in uniform were standing in the
path, one a step or two in advance of the other. Nobody
who had seen any of the later photographs could
have failed to recognize the foremost officer as the
Kaiser, though the portraits were idealized. The face
of the original was older, the nose heavier, and the
figure shorter, stockier than I had expected. Nor
had I been told about the scar high up on the left
cheek. I was so taken by surprise that I lost my
presence of mind. Jumping up, I dropped my book,
and knocked over the light wicker chair which was
supposed to be of British manufacture. I was so
ashamed of my awkwardness&mdash;such a bad example to
the children!&mdash;that I could have cried. To make matters
worse the Emperor burst out laughing, a good-natured
laugh, but embarrassing to me, as I was the
object of his merriment.</p>

<p>"I have upset the United Kingdom and the United
States of America!" his Imperial Majesty haw-hawed
in good English, though in rather a harsh voice, making
a gesture of the right hand toward the chair of
alleged British make, and the fallen book with George
Henty's name on its back, at the same time giving me
one of the most direct looks I have ever had, full in
the face. It seemed to challenge me, and I remembered
having heard that a short cut to the Kaiser's
favor was a smart repartee. The worst of it was
that like a flash I thought of one which would be pat,
if impertinent, but I dared not risk it.</p>

<p>Luckily my two Princes rushed past me to throw
themselves upon their sovereign, and their cousin followed
suit, more timidly. Perhaps she had discovered
that his Imperial Majesty does not much care
for little girls unless they are pretty.</p>

<p>The Kaiser was kind but short in his greeting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the children, and did not seem to notice that they
expected to be kissed. Probably he was not satisfied
as to their state of health, as they had been sent
out of an infected town, and he has never conquered
his horror of contagious diseases. With his right
hand (he seldom uses the left) on the dark head of
the elder boy, he pivoted him round with rough playfulness.
"Don't you see that Miss &mdash;&mdash;'s chair and
book are on the floor?" inquired the "All Highest."
"What is a gentleman's duty&mdash;I mean pleasure&mdash;when
a lady drops anything?"</p>

<p>"To pick it up," replied the child, his face red as he
hurried back into the summer-house and suited the
action to the word.</p>

<p>"Very good, though late," said the Kaiser. Then,
no doubt thinking that I had had time to recover myself,
he turned to me, more quizzical than ever. "Perhaps
according to present ideas in England I am old-fashioned?
But I hope you are not English enough
to be a suffragette, Miss &mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>I recognized the great compliment of his knowing
my name, as I am sure he expected. I had heard already
that suffragettes were to the Emperor as red
rags to a bull, and that he always brought up the
subject with Englishwomen when he met them for
the first time. I ventured to remark that to be English
was not necessarily to be a suffragette.</p>

<p>He shook his finger at me like a schoolmaster, though
he smiled.</p>

<p>"Ah, but you are not an Englishwoman, or you
would not say that! All these modern Englishwomen
are suffragettes. Well, we should show them what
we think of them if they sent a deputation here. But
while they confine themselves to their own soil we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
can bless them. They are sowing good seed for us
to reap."</p>

<p>I had no idea what his Majesty meant by the last
sentences, though I could see that an innuendo was
intended. His certainty that he was right about all
modern Englishwomen was only what I had seen in
visitors to Schloss &mdash;&mdash;, every one of whom, especially
the Prussians, knew far more about English
ideas and customs than the English knew about themselves.
I had sometimes disputed their statements,
though without effect, but I could not contradict the
Emperor. All I could do was to wonder what he
had meant by "sowing the good seed," and a glance
he had thrown to his aide-de-camp (or "adjutant,"
as the officer might more Germanly be called), but
it is only after these five years that I have perhaps
guessed the riddle. The Kaiser must even then have
begun to count on the weakening of England by its
threatened "war of the sexes."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Emperor proceeded to introduce his officer attendant,
who was a Count von H&mdash;&mdash;. He informed
me that he and his suite had travelled all night in
the royal train, to inspect the nearby garrison and
breakfast with the officers. Having a short time to
spare, he had arranged to motor up to Schloss &mdash;&mdash;
and have a look at the children, in order that he might
report on the Princes' health to their mother and
father the next time they saw each other.</p>

<p>"No sign of the malady coming out in them?" he
inquired. "And the youngest? He, too, is all right?"</p>

<p>On hearing that the baby was not as well as could
be wished, he looked anxious, but cheered up when
he heard that the feverishness was caused by cutting
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is not contagious!" said he. "Though some
of us might be glad to 'catch' a wisdom tooth."</p>

<p>When he made a "witticism," he laughed out aloud,
opening his mouth, throwing back his head slightly
with a little jerk, and looking one straight in the eyes
to see if one had appreciated the fun of the saying.
The more one laughed the better he seemed pleased,
and the more lively he became, almost like a merry
child. But when the subject was dismissed, and he
began to think of something else, I noticed&mdash;not only
on that day, but on others, later&mdash;that occasionally
an odd, wandering, strained expression came into
his eyes. For a moment he would appear older than
his age; though when his mind was fixed upon himself,
and he was "braced" by self-consciousness, he
looked almost young and very vital, if fatter than
his favorite photographs represented him.</p>

<p>That day at Schloss &mdash;&mdash; the Emperor did not
stay with us longer than twenty minutes at most, but
he managed to chat about many things in that time,
the latter part of which was spent in talking with
Lieutenant von X&mdash;&mdash;, to find whom he sent the
younger of my Princes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have heard that the Kaiser is always anxious as
to the first impression he makes, even upon the most
insignificant middle-class person; and having delivered
himself of this harangue, he set to work to smooth
me down before departing. He asked questions
about myself, and the family (his friends) with whom
I had lived in England. With his head thrust forward
and wagging slightly, he mentioned several advantages
which an English governess had over a
German one; and then he blurted out, sharply and
suddenly, that, if my little Princes' parents had listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to his advice, they would have had an Englishwoman
for their children two years sooner. "But
the Princess &mdash;&mdash; is the most self-willed woman I
know," he said. "You may think I am indiscreet!
I am forever accused by newspapers of being indiscreet,
because I speak what I think. But this is no
secret. You will learn it for yourself if you are as
intelligent as I suppose. She never was intended by
nature to be a wife and mother, though she would be
a charming person if she were neither. As it is she
will do what she likes in spite of everything and
everyone. There! I have said enough&mdash;or too much.
Where is von X&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The Lieutenant was hovering in the background,
ready for an auspicious moment: and the Emperor
turned his attention to the governor of my elder
Prince. It was not till he was ready to go that he
had another word for me, and then it was only "Auf
wiedersehen." He graciously put out his hand, palm
down, for me to shake. I noticed how large it was
in contrast with the left, which he kept out of the way.
It was beautifully cared for, and there were more
rings on it than an Englishman or American would
wear, but it was not an attractive shape, and looked
somehow unhealthy. As if in punishment to me for
such a thought, the big hand gave mine a fearful grip.
It was like the closing of a vise, and I could almost
hear my bones crack. I wondered if the Emperor
had cultivated this trick to show how strong he was;
but I should have been glad to take his strength on
faith.</p>

<p>I could not help wincing, though I tried not to let
my face change. If it did, he appeared to take no notice.
He had finished with me, after a military salute; and
letting the children run by his side, he and his attendant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with Lieutenant von X&mdash;&mdash;, walked down
the path....</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF BERNHARDI AND THE KRUPPS</p>

<p>One of the most interesting things that happened to
me in my first year was a visit (with the Princess, of
course) to Villa Hügel, the house of Herr and Frau
Krupp von Bohlen, in the Ruhr valley near Essen.
Bertha Krupp, the "Cannon Queen" and richest German
heiress in Germany, if not the world, had been
married to the South German diplomat, Gustav von
Bohlen und Halbach, less than four years. She was
only about twenty-four, but the coming of children
had aged her as it does all German women apparently,
and she had already ceased to look girlish. Her husband,
who is sixteen or seventeen years senior to his
wife, might have been no more than ten years older,
to judge by their appearance when together. He put
the name of Krupp in front of his own immediately
after his marriage with the heiress, and few people
add the "und Halbach" now, except officially....</p>

<p>While I was in the "Spatzenhaus" with the boys,
Herr Krupp von Bohlen brought in these four gentlemen
and another, to see the celebrated visitors' book
kept there since Bertha and Barbara were children.
General von Bernhardi had arrived the night previous,
and this was my first sight of him, as well, of course,
of Herr Eccius and Doctor Linden.</p>

<p>I was more interested in the last of the three, because
I had listened while Frau Krupp von Bohlen repeated
to the children a wonderful story about the
intelligence of some fish in the Naples Aquarium; and
all I knew then of General von Bernhardi was that he
was considered a great soldier, and had been the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
officer to ride into Paris in 1871, or some tale of that
sort. However, the minute I saw him I felt that here
was a tremendous personality, and an intensely repellent
one, a man to be reckoned with. I determined
to ask a great many questions concerning him of the
Countess, who knew everything about everybody, and
did not object to telling what she knew with embellishments.</p>

<p>My name was politely mentioned by the host, and the
visiting gentlemen all bowed to me. The only one who
did so stiffly, as if he grudged bending his thick, short
neck for my benefit, was General von Bernhardi. He
gave me one sharp look from under his rather beetling
eyebrows, and I wondered if he despised all women,
or had merely taken a distaste to me.</p>

<p>"You are English?" he asked shortly, in German,
his tone being that of a man accustomed to throw out
commands as you might throw a battle-ax.</p>

<p>"She was born in Washington," said Herr Krupp
von Bohlen, in his pleasant, cultivated voice. "Washington
is the most interesting city of the United States,
and holds pleasant memories for me. Miss &mdash;&mdash;'s
grandfather was a distinguished American naval officer."</p>

<p>As he said this, he gave me a faint, rather humorous
smile, which I interpreted as a warning or request not
to try explaining my antecedents.</p>

<p>"Ach! That is better!" grunted the General. And
I knew that, whatever might be his attitude toward
women in general, Englishwomen were anyhow beyond
the pale.</p>

<p>(Later I heard from the Countess that women were
not much higher than the "four-footed animal kingdom"
for Bernhardi; that he loudly contradicted his
wife, even at hotel tables, when they traveled together;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that he always walked ahead of her in the street, and
pushed past her or even other ladies, if strangers to
him, in order to go first through a doorway.)</p>

<p>The General condescended to glance at me, and
I thought again that he was the most ruthless, brutal-looking
man I had ever met, the very type of militarism
in flesh and blood&mdash;especially blood.</p>

<p>"You are a friend of the English?" he inquired.</p>

<p>I dared to stand up for England by answering that
I thought her the greatest country in the world.</p>

<p>"That is nonsense," was his comment. I shall never
forget it, or the cutting way in which it was spoken.</p>

<p>The Prince, though knowing me to be English
(which Bernhardi, to do him justice, did not), backed
the General up, explaining for my benefit as well as
the children's that England might once have been
nominally the most powerful nation, owing to her
talent for grabbing possessions all over the world,
and the cleverness of her diplomacy. But, he said,
that was different now, under the Liberal Government.
England was going down exactly as Rome had
gone down, and the knell of her greatness was sounding
already. Not one of her colonies would stand by
her when her day of trouble should come, and most
of them would go against her.</p>

<p>"You have only to read their own newspapers,"
said General Bernhardi, "to see that the English know
they are degenerating fast. But the hand of Fate
is on them. They are asleep, and they will wake up
with a rude shock only when it is too late."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE CROWN PRINCE AND THE
CROWN PRINCESS</p>

<p>Some quite innocent tales were told by the tattlers,
of the Crown Princess. One was, that she had determined
from the moment of her engagement to his
Imperial Highness, to be the most beautiful and best
dressed royal lady in Europe, as he strongly desired
her to be, and that it almost broke her heart when she
began to realize that being the mother of one baby
after another was enlarging her slender waist. She
was supposed to have had a wax model of herself
made, soon after the birth of her first boy: face, hair,
and figure all resembling her own as faithfully as
possible. According to the story, she had every new
fashion of hairdressing tried on this model, before deciding
to use it herself, and would have milliners fit
it with hats, rather than choose one to suit her own
style merely from seeing it in the mirror. Gowns were
shown to her in the same way when they arrived
from Paris or Vienna, said the gossip who told me the
tale, and the first time the measurements which fitted
the figurine proved too small for the Princess's waist,
there were tears.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>I did not fall in love with noisy Berlin, though
Unter den Linden is so fine and imposing, with all its
beautiful shops and trees. The city was so neat and
square, so stolid and self-respecting that the capital of
Prussia made me think of the Prussian character as
I soon began to judge it. Potsdam I found more interesting
because it is old and historic. We spent a
good deal of time in both places, and I used often to
see the Emperor motoring in a yellow car with a
very small Prussian royal standard on it to show who
was the owner. The Crown Prince was always dashing
about, too, generally driving himself, very recklessly,
with a cigarette in his mouth, and looking about
here and there, everywhere except where he was going.
He had a black imp for a "mascot" on his automobile,
a thing that waved its arms in a way to
frighten horses, though it never seemed to do so. And
sometimes the car would be full of ladies and children
and several quite large dogs that walked over their
owners and tried to jump out. The crowds seemed
to like him, and the Crown Princess, whom they called
"the sunshine of Berlin," even more. She was always
very gracious, bowing and smiling, while the Crown
Prince looked extremely bored. Still, if he had not
been hailed with enthusiasm, I am sure he would have
been vexed. Sometimes he would appear at a window
of the palace, perhaps with one of the royal children
in his arms, pretending not to notice the people
outside gazing at him. But I thought he looked self-conscious,
as if he were doing it all for effect....</p>

<p>What I had heard from the Countess about the
Crown Prince going to India and Egypt in the character
of a "glorified spy" (even though I doubted the
assertion) and the intimate talk of our Prince's "influence"
in the Secret Service department, made me
think more about spies and spying in a few months,
than I had ever thought in my whole life. I began to
look about for spies, and wonder if any of the much
traveled, cultured people I met were engaged in spying
with some of the highest in the land virtually at
their head. The last person I should have connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with the profession of spying, however, was Herr Steinhauer.
Even now I cannot be sure that he and the
famous "master spy" of whom I have heard so much
since I came back to England, are one and the same;
but everything goes to prove that they are....</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF A VISIT FROM COUNT
ZEPPELIN</p>

<p>Once in Berlin, Count Zeppelin came, after having
taken the Crown Prince, and my little Princes' father
as well as one or two of their army friends, for a flight
in his newest airship. Our Prince came back very
enthusiastic after his trip, and wanted his elder son
to go, but the Princess would not hear of this, and
Count Zeppelin backed her up. He said that he did
not know enough about children's nerves to risk an
experiment, though he believed such boys as ours
would stand it well. He told them, when they both
begged to go, that they must content themselves with
the "game" for a few years, and asked a good many
questions of Lieutenant von X&mdash;&mdash; (who was present
by request) as to how the little players got on with
it. When he was talking of ordinary things, his face
looked good-natured, even benevolent, with his rather
scanty white hair and comfortable baldness. I
thought, with a false beard, he would have exactly
the right figure and face for Santa Claus; but as he
listened to Lieutenant von X&mdash;&mdash;'s account of how he
taught the Princes to "play the game," and examined
some of the toy buildings (so often powdered white
with "bombs" that they could no longer be brushed
completely clean), his face hardened, looking very
stern and very old, his bright eyes almost hiding between
wrinkled lids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The Count took the elder boy between his knees,
and catechised him as to some of the rules. The little
boy was shy at first, but soon plucked up courage,
and answered in a brisk and warlike way.</p>

<p>"This is a born soldier," said the airship inventor,
laying his hand on the child's hair. "By the time he
is ready for sky battles, we shall have something colossal
to give him; but in the meantime, please Heaven,
we shall make very good use of what we have got."...</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF GENERAL VON KLUCK&mdash;"THE
OLD DARE-DEVIL"</p>

<p>Among other distinguished men who came to see
my Princes and their plays, was General von Kluck&mdash;another
one of those "great dome heads!" To me,
it seemed the best part of his personality, and certainly
the development was far superior to what I had named
the "German officer head," a crude, unfinished type of
head, which gives the impression that the skull has
hardened before the brain had time to finish growing.
General von Kluck did not talk at all to me, or
appear to take any interest in the toy soldiers' battle.
He had the air of being absent-minded and thinking
deeply of something far away, in space. I heard him
say that "they" wanted him to go to France to look
at it. Who "they" were, I do not know, or what "it"
was that they wished General von Kluck to see. But
I knew that nearly a year after that visit the children
had a present of a fancy red velvet box of chocolate.
The Princess herself brought it into the schoolroom
(we seldom had a lesson that was not interrupted in
some way or other), and as the covering had already
been removed, I do not know if the box had been sent
from a distance or had come by hand. The Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
showed the boys General von Kluck's visiting card,
and the writing on it, which said, "French chocolate
from France, for two brave young German soldiers."</p>

<p>Later that day the Prince came and asked to see
the box "from old von Kluck," which by that time was
half empty. He looked at the card, and laughed. "The
old dare-devil!" he chuckled. Then he said that, as
we had eaten so much in such a short time it showed that
French chocolate was good.</p>

<p>I seldom or never had any real conversation with
the Prince, and it was not my place to ask questions;
but I wondered why General von Kluck was an "old
dare-devil" to go to France, and why the Prince seemed
so pleased and amused about it. Also I remembered
what I had heard the General say some months before,
about France. I thought that there must be a
mystery about it, either official, or something to do
with a lady, perhaps a Frenchwoman. I know no
more now than I knew then; but I have heard it
said since I came back to England, by a Frenchman,
that General von Kluck is supposed to have visited
France incognito, to look at some quarries near Soissons,
which Germans bought and secretly made ready
to use as trenches, beginning their work a year before
the war broke out.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF THE CONFESSION OF
LIEUTENANT VON X&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I often asked Lieutenant von X&mdash;&mdash; what the German
army thought about the future of Germany, and
I do not think he suspected in the least that I had any
motive except "intelligent interest." He had come to
look upon me as a family institution, and without
telling lies in so many words, I allowed him to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that I felt Germany's vast superiority over the rest
of the world. It is a simple thing for any woman to
make any German man believe this. The only difficult
thing for him to understand is that a creature can be
benighted enough to have a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>Lieutenant von X&mdash;&mdash; admitted that the German
army as well as navy prayed for "The Day." He
thought that Germany could "walk through France,"
and she, being far superior to Russia in every way,
could not help but win in a war against that power,
even without the help of Austria. He seemed to feel
contempt for Austria and everything Austrian compared
with what was German, but he said "she can
be useful to us." As for England, she might be a
tougher job, but it would "have to come," and with
the improved Zeppelins (which England had been a
"stupid-head" not to copy as well as she could) and
the Krupp secrets, there was no doubt who would
come out on top: Germany, the one power on earth
who deserved by her gloriousness to be over all others.
America, too, eventually must become Germanized,
as Lieutenant von X&mdash;&mdash; believed she was already
well on the way to be, with her growing German
population, immense German financial interests, and influential
newspapers. The plans for American conquest
were already mapped out by the German War
Office, who never left anything to chance. He said
that this was no secret, or he would not mention it.
There was once a hope that Germany and England
might make a combination against the United States,
but that had been abandoned, he said. Once I should
have taken this for a joke, and also the expectation
that when France was conquered (with Belgium
thrown in as a matter of course) Antwerp and Dunkirk
and Calais would all be German, becoming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
strongest military ports in the world; but I had learned
better now. I knew that Lieutenant von X&mdash;&mdash;, who
seldom originated any ideas of his own, was simply
repeating to me the sort of talk he heard among his
brother officers....</p>

<p>(The English-American Governess from this point
relates a most remarkable story, every word of which
is vouched for as the truth. She tells how Von Hindenburg,
the Crown Prince, and other notables met
in secret sessions at the palace where she was residing;
about their relations with Prince Mohammed Ali and
Enver Bey, the Envoy from Turkey; the intrigues in
the days before the outbreak of the war; the scenes
in the royal households when war was declared; and
how she escaped at midnight, September 15, 1914. It
is a revelation that gives one a clearer insight into the
causes of the Great War and how the Hohenzollerns
had planned for many years to enter upon a conquest
of Europe and America.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

<h2>"FROM CONVENT TO CONFLICT"&mdash;A
VISION OF INFERNO</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Or, A Nun's Account of the Invasion of
Belgium</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>By Sister Antonia, Convent des Filles de Marie,
Willebroeck, Province of Antwerp, Belgium</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the appeal of a nun, who in the fullness of her heart
tells the American people of the noble efforts of her Sisters to
bring solace and comfort to agonized Belgium. Sisters Mary
Antonia and Mary Cecilia were sent to the United States with
the approval of Cardinal Mercier, Archbishop of Malines, with
the following credentials: "The Superior of the Convent of
the Daughters of Mary, Willebroeck, Provence of Antwerp,
Belgium, state by this present (letter) that the Sisters Mary
Antonia and Mary Cecilia are sent to the United States in
order to examine if there are means of establishing a colony
(mission) of the Daughters of Mary there; she gives to Sister
M. Antonia the power to act in her name as to taking the
measures necessary to this effect." Sister Antonia tells her
noble story in a little volume (published by <i>John Murphy
Company</i>, Baltimore. Copyright, 1916) with this introduction:
"The hope is indulged that the harrowing scenes witnessed by
the author in Belgium, after the German invasion in 1914, may
induce her own countrymen and women to more fully appreciate
the blessings of peace. The events narrated are set forth
as actually occurring, and&mdash;'with malice to none, with charity
for all.' Any profits derived from its favorable reception by the
reading public or the charitably inclined are to be devoted to
the reconstruction and repair of our school and convent, damaged
during the engagement at the Fortress of Willebroeck, or
for the establishment of a sewing school, with a lace making
department, for young women in America or England, as our
Reverend Superiors may decide." The editors take pleasure in
commending this book and in extending their appreciation to
the publishers for their courtesy in allowing these selections.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE FATEFUL DAY IN THE
CONVENT</p>

<p>A merry group of Convent girls, in charge of Sister
guardian, was seated in the shade of a huge old pear
tree, discussing the joys and expectations of the approaching
summer vacation. High are the walls enclosing
this ancient cloister, and many are the gay
young hearts protected and developed within its shady
precincts.</p>

<p>Bright are the faces and happy the hearts of more
than one hundred young girls on this midsummer day
in the memorable year 1914....</p>

<p>July's sun sank gently away on the western horizon,
and its last rays lit up the ripening fruit, the plants
and flowers in the garden. It seemed to linger for a
last farewell to the groups of merry children who, unconscious
of their fast-approaching woe, were cheerfully
singing Belgium's well-known national song,
"The Proud Flemish Lion."</p>

<p>In a few moments the "Golden Gate" closed on a
field of purple haze, shutting out that blessed glimpse
of heaven, while the black shroud of the most dismal
night in history darkened the sky of that hapless nation.</p>

<p>The Sisters were together in the evening recreation
of that fateful day, when word was received that King
Albert of Belgium, in order to fulfill his obligations
of neutrality, had refused the Kaiser's army access
to his territory to attack the French. Had a thunderbolt
fallen from a clear sky, or an earthquake shaken
the ground under foot, it would scarcely have surprised
or terrorized the people more than did the Kaiser's
declaration of war against this free and happy
little kingdom....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>One Sunday morning, about the middle of August,
an unusual tumult was heard on the street. The door
bell was loudly rung, and a messenger admitted with
news that the officers of the Belgian War Department
had commanded everything within firing range of the
fortress to be cleared away at once. For some time
previous the soldiers had been busy cutting down the
groves and all the trees in the immediate vicinity of
the fortress. The poor people were given just three
hours to get away with bag and baggage.</p>

<p>This was a terrible misfortune for about six hundred
families, whose dwellings, being located within the limits
prescribed, had to be leveled to the ground. Even the
tombstones in the cemetery, together with all the crops,
trees, haystacks, barns and everything within range of the
gaping mouths of the cannon, had to be laid flat or taken
away.</p>

<p>No wonder that the people raced to and fro that hot
Sunday morning, carrying bundles, dragging wagons
with household furniture and fixtures; wheeling
trunks, clothing, stoves, pictures, bedding and every
article that could be taken up and carried away. Tears
and perspiration rolled over the cheeks of men and
women, whose faces glowed from the heat and intense
excitement....</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE SOLDIERS AT LIEGE</p>

<p>In the meantime a most terrible battle was taking
place at the fortification of Liege. Was ever attack
so strong or resistance more determined? Belgian
officers said, "The enemy were twenty to one against
us; but, being obliged to face the terrible fires of the
fortress, their ranks were cut down in about the same
manner as wheat is cut off by the reaper." "So great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was the number of the Germans that they seemed to
spring up out of the ground." "They crawled ahead on
hands and feet, and at a given signal sprang erect and
fired, and then again prostrated themselves. Thus they
advanced, avoiding as much as possible the heavy
fires in front." Another Belgian officer at the fortress
during the battle said: "It resembled a storm of fiery
hailstones from a cloud of smoke, in an atmosphere
suffocating with heat and the smell of powder."</p>

<p>Eye-witnesses relate that heaps of slain, yards high,
were found on the battlefield, while columns of lifeless
bodies were observed in a standing position, there being
no place for the dead to fall.</p>

<p>A story was told by one of the Belgian officers of a
German soldier who, when wounded by a Belgian in a
hand-to-hand combat, took out a coin and presented it.
The Belgian, surprised, exclaimed "Zijt gij zot?" (Are
you crazy?) "Do you not know that I've broken your
arm?" "Yes," said the German, "This is to show my
gratitude for the favor you've rendered me, since it
gives me the opportunity of leaving the battlefield."</p>

<p>Much was said about the valor of the soldiers on
both sides during the siege of Liege. The Germans
were obliged to advance in the face of destructive
fires. If one should retreat, he would be pierced by
the bayonet of the soldier behind him....</p>

<p>While facing death in this first great battle at the
fortress of Liege, one of the soldiers began to sing
the well-known national hymn, "The Proud Flemish
Lion." Immediately the strains were taken up by the
whole regiment, and thus singing, they advanced until
hundreds of them fell in that awful conflict.</p>

<p>In the heaviest of the fray we were told that King
Albert had placed himself in the lines with his soldiers.
He did not desire to be called king, but comrade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
His military dress was distinguished from the
others by only a small mark on one of the sleeves. He
attended to the correspondence for his soldiers and was
regarded by them as a friend and father, under whose
guidance they were ready to fight and die.</p>

<p>When the siege was over he visited the wounded
in many of the hospitals and addressed each soldier in
person....</p>

<p>After the fall of Liege and Namur, the destruction
of Louvain and a number of noted cities, towns and
villages, our minds were concerned with that awe-inspiring
event&mdash;the advance of the enemy to Brussels.</p>

<p>Well do we remember that beautiful summer evening,
when our prayers and evening meditation in the
chapel were disturbed for about an hour by the continuous
whirl of automobiles passing the Convent.
We were told that evening that it was the departure
of the legislative body from Brussels to Antwerp, with
the archives and treasures of the Government.</p>

<p>Our hearts seemed to grow cold and leaden within
us as we sat there hoping, praying, fearing, yet instinctively
feeling the doom so rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>One gloomy, rainy day, word came that over two
thousand soldiers of the Civil Guard had lowered their
weapons at the approach of the enemy and quietly
surrendered the City of Brussels, Belgium's beautiful
capital. To have fought without fortifications against
such superior forces as the Germans possessed would
have been a useless sacrifice of life.</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE PRIESTS, DOCTORS AND
RED CROSS NURSES</p>

<p>One afternoon in the middle of August a large,
heavy wagon was drawn into the yard. It bore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
flag of the Red Cross on top, and on the side in great
white letters the words "Military Hospital."</p>

<p>In a few minutes a fleshy little gentleman, who at
once distinguished himself as the "Chef" (chief), and
a number of other gentlemen, about thirty-five in all,
wearing white bands with red crosses on their arms,
and long white linen coats over their uniforms, such
as bakers sometimes wear, were seen hurrying to and
fro, unpacking and carrying their various instruments
and utensils to the operating room.</p>

<p>A military chaplain and four or more doctors accompanied
the group. All except the chaplain were
dressed in uniform. Several young ladies of Willebroeck,
former members of our Boarding-school,
dressed in white and wearing the head-dress and arm-band
of the Red Cross, came next day and graciously
presented themselves to aid in taking care of the
wounded.</p>

<p>Coffins were provided by our village for the soldiers
who died in our hospital....</p>

<p>The condition of the poor maimed soldiers (as they
were brought into the convent) was sad to behold.
One man, we were told by the Red Cross nurses, had
twenty bullets in his body; another was pierced
through the lung by a bayonet; one, aged twenty, lost
an arm to the shoulder; one had only one or two fingers
left on the hand; one was crazed by a bullet
which touched the brain; another was shot through the
mouth, the bullet lodging in the back of the throat.
His case was especially distressing, his the most intense
suffering of all. He lived for a week without
eating, drinking or speaking.</p>

<p>Three wounded Germans were brought in, being
picked up on the battlefield by members of our division
of the Red Cross. They seemed greatly distressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and afraid, positively refusing to touch food
or drink of which the Sisters or nurses did not first
partake.</p>

<p>One day we were called upon to witness a most
sorrowful sight. A small farmer's wagon drove up to
the gate, bearing the lifeless bodies of two children, a
girl aged eight and her brother, aged fourteen. The
mother and a smaller child were also in the wagon.
The mother related that they were taking flight as
refugees. Seeing the enemy, they hastened to retreat,
and were fired at by the soldiers. The children,
who were in the back part of the wagon, were struck
and wounded in a most frightful manner. The little
girl's face was nearly all torn off, and the back of the
boy's head had been shattered.</p>

<p>At the approach of Belgian soldiers, who fired at the
enemy, the mother was enabled to pick up the lifeless
bodies of her children, put them into the wagon and
drive with them to our hospital, which was the nearest
post.</p>

<p>A little after four o'clock one afternoon, shortly before
the departure of the first division of the Red
Cross, our attention was attracted by the heavy and
continuous tread of cavalry and soldiers passing along
the street. It was the Belgian army returning from a
long and tiresome march.</p>

<p>Here was found a different kind of suffering from
that which was ministered to in the hospital. Hunger
and fatigue were stamped upon the countenance of
each of these men, who, about a month before were
industrious citizens at their daily occupations.</p>

<p>There were in the ranks priests, in their long black
cassocks, wearing the arm-band of the Red Cross, who,
as volunteer chaplains, had joined the army and were
ever at the service of the soldiers on the march, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
even on the battlefield. We were informed that
priests, and those preparing for the priesthood, were
not obliged to serve in the army in time of peace; but,
in case of war, they may be called upon to serve as
military chaplains. When the present war broke out,
hundreds of them joined as volunteers, marching in
the ranks with the soldiers and undergoing their sufferings
and hardships.</p>

<p>Many doctors rode along in motor cars. They were
distinguished by a special dark-colored uniform, with
a red collar and gilded trimmings. They also wore
the arm-band of the Red Cross. Officers on horseback
led each division of the army. The faces of all were
disfigured with sweat and dust, while dust in abundance
covered shoes and clothing. Some were staggering
along, unable to walk straight, owing to the hard
shoes and blistered feet. Hollow-cheeked, and with
eyes which seemed to protrude from their sockets,
they passed along, piteously imploring a morsel of
bread.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the abundant supply of bread in the
Convent had just been increased by the addition of
forty of those immense loaves found only in Belgium.
All of this was hastily cut, buttered and, with baskets
full of pears, dealt out, piece by piece, to the passing
soldiers, until, finally, only a small portion remained
over for the supper of the wounded remaining
in the hospital....</p>

<p>Before the command was given to enter the schools,
we saw soldiers, among whom were also priests, lying
on the ground on the opposite side of the street, even
as horses which, having run a great distance, fall
down from sheer exhaustion. Some of these, we
learned afterwards, did not have their shoes off in
nearly three weeks. The socks, hard and worn out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were in some cases stamped into the blistered feet in
such a manner as to cause excruciating pain. In some
cases the feet were so painful and swollen that the
patients had to be carried in on stretchers. In the
meantime, several ambulance wagons had stopped at
the school gate, and numerous wounded were carried
in.</p>

<p>We retired at a late hour one night amid the incessant
booming of cannon. Scarcely were our eyes
closed when some one passed in the dormitory and
knocked at each door. "Ave Maria," was the quiet
greeting. "Deo Gratias," the response. "What is it?"
was asked. "The Germans have entered and are crossing
the bridge," was the reply.</p>

<p>With beating heart and trembling limbs, each
sprang up and was dressed in a few minutes. In a
state of great excitement, all stood in the hall ready
to receive orders from the Superior, who had gone
downstairs to make inquiries about the situation....</p>

<p>The crackling of shells, the heavy cannonade from
the fortress and field cannon, and the occasional proximity
of those hostile aeroplanes, together with the
reports of atrocities and destruction taking place
around us, were fearsome in the extreme.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to the noise and commotion on
all sides, was the calm tranquility which reigned in
the chapel. The Sacred Heart stretched forth that
same Fatherly hand which assisted the apostle sinking
on the Sea of Galilee. The altar was still and solitary,
but the little red light flickered in the sanctuary
lamp and told of Him whose word alone stilled the
winds and calmed the angry waves....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE HEROIC REFUGEES</p>

<p>Sorrowful scenes were witnessed along the streets.
Our attention and sympathies were particularly attracted
to the flight of the refugees.</p>

<p>For hours and days and weeks the doleful procession
passed along the streets; a living stream made up of
all ranks and classes of society. Here were seen the
poor old farmer's household, whose sons had gone to
the front; and young married women, with small children
in their arms or by their sides, whose husbands
had to don the soldier's uniform and go to the war.
The sick, the old and the feeble were taken from their
beds of suffering and, with shawls or blankets thrown
over their shoulders, placed in carts or wagons and
carried away, perhaps, to perish by the roadside. We
have seen cripples and small children hurriedly driven
along the street in wheelbarrows.</p>

<p>Packages carried on their arms, on their backs, or
in little carts were about all that the poor people could
take....</p>

<p>It was most pitiful to see these poor people, whose
only object was to get away as far as possible from
the scenes of conflict. Some carried small loaves of
bread; others had a little hay or straw in their wagons;
some led a cow or two; others two or three pigs. In
some of the carts we recognized faces of our former
pupils, who only one short month before were longing
for the pleasant vacation days. Their fathers or brothers
were in the army, and their homes forsaken. Some
children had lost their parents and were crying piteously.</p>

<p>When the Sisters left the parish church, where they
daily took part in the public devotions for peace, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
were besieged by hundreds of these poor, half-frantic
refugees, beseeching shelter over night in the church
or schools, which were already full to overflowing.
The days were warm and pleasant, but the nights were
very chilly and sometimes rainy. Where would those
poor people go and what could they do without food
or shelter for all those little children? The friendly
stars looked down from the realms above upon thousands
who lay along the roadside, while others
crowded the barns and country schools, or made rude
tent-like shelters in the bed of the new canal.</p>

<p>The Sisters, wholly absorbed in their work for the
wounded, and relying on the word of the Belgian officers,
that timely warning would be given as to the
necessity of departure, had as yet no idea of joining
the throngs of refugees who continuously filed through
the main streets.</p>

<p>The shocks of the cannonade from the fortress
caused the buildings to tremble on their foundations,
while the ground under foot seemed agitated as by an
earthquake. A large number of wounded soldiers had
been brought in the night before, and three or four
lay dead in the mortuary.</p>

<p>Our Sisters and servant maids, as also the generous
women refugees of Willebroeck, continued their
sickening task in the laundry. In wooden shoes they
stood at those large cement tubs while suds and blood-dyed
water streamed over the stone floor.</p>

<p>Night closed in again, but brought neither rest nor
consolation. Fearing to retire, some of the Sisters
remained in the chapel, while others spent the tedious
hours of that dreary night in the refectory or adjoining
rooms, and kept busy making surgical dressings for
the wounded, of whom a larger number than usual
had been brought into the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>At intervals during the night the cannonade was
heard, while the searchlights of the fortress penetrated
the clouds on the lookout for the murderous Zeppelins.
Morning came at last, with an increase of work
and anguish. The enemy, with their usual determination,
were trying to force their way through to Antwerp,
while the Belgians were equally determined to
prevent them, or to at least check their progress.</p>

<p>An officer called for the Reverend Superior and said
in an excited manner, "Weg van hier, aanstonds!
Geen tijd te verliezen." (Away from here at once!
No time to be lost.) This message flew from one to
another, even to the terror-stricken hearts of the numerous
wounded.</p>

<p>Impossible to describe the scenes which followed.
In a few minutes a long line of motor cars came whirling
up to the gate to take away the wounded who,
some of them in an almost dying condition, were being
dragged out of their beds, dressed and hurriedly carried
away to Antwerp, or to another place of refuge.
One can never forget the look of anguish on some of
their faces, while others seemed totally indifferent to
all that was taking place around them....</p>

<h2>"WAR LETTERS OF AN AMERICAN

<p class="center"><i>Experiences in the Siege of Paris</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>By Marie Van Vorst, Distinguished American Novelist
Residing in Paris</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>These letters present a singularly vivid chronicle of an American
woman's experiences during the Great War. She was living
in Paris, but brought her mother to London for safety. Here
she went through a course of Red Cross lectures and returned
to become a nurse at the American Ambulance in the Pasteur
Institute in Neuilly, then under the control of Mrs. W. K.
Vanderbilt. Her brilliant intellect and sympathizing heart are
brought out in her letters to friends in America. Her whole
soul is in the cause of the Allies and in her letters she tells
many beautiful stories of her experiences in Paris, London,
Nice and Rome. To read her impressions as she wrote them
down for her friends is to recapture the thrill and the uplift,
the sorrows and the hopes, the high resolves and unshakable
purpose of those that will live forever in history. Several
letters are reprinted here by permission of her publisher, <i>John

<p>I&mdash;STORY OF ROBERT LE ROUX</p>

<p class="center"><i>To Miss Anna Lusk, New York.</i></p>

<p class="right">
Paris, Nov. 7th, 1914.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Anna</span>:</p>

<p>In the contemplation of the great griefs of those who
have lost their own, of those who have given their all;
in the contemplation of the bravest country in the world&mdash;Belgium&mdash;ravaged
from frontier to frontier, laid barren
and waste, smoked, ruined, devastated and scarred by
wholesale massacre of civilian women and children, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
hearts have been crushed. Our souls have been appalled
by the burdens of others, and by the future problems of
Belgium, not to speak of one quarter of France. Much
of the north has been wiped out, and the stories of individual
suffering and insults too terrible to dwell upon,
you will say.</p>

<p>One of my old clerks in the Bon Marché has had his
little nephew come back to him from Germany&mdash;a peaceful
young middle-class man pursuing his studies in a
German town&mdash;with both his hands cut off!</p>

<p>The other day in the Gare du Nord, waiting for a
train, there was a stunning Belgian officer&mdash;not a private&mdash;he
was a captain in one of the crack regiments. His
excitement was terrible, he was almost beside himself
with anguish and with anger. In a little village he had
seen one woman violated by seven Germans in the presence
of her husband; then the husband shot, the woman
shot and her little baby cut in four pieces on a butcher's
block. You can hardly call this the common course
of war. He was a Belgian gentleman, and I should consider
this a document of truth.</p>

<p>But there are so many that I cannot prolong, and will
not&mdash;what is the use? Every now and then a people
needs to be wiped off the face of the earth, or a contingent
blotted out that a newer and finer civilization shall
prevail. Certainly this is the case with Germany. They
say here that the Emperor and Crown Prince will be
tried by law and sentenced to death as common criminals,
the Emperor as a murderer and the Crown Prince as
a robber, for his goods trains were stacked with booty
and loot. Think of it, a Prince! Everywhere the Germans
pass they leave their filthy insults behind them, in
the beautiful châteaux and in the delicate rooms of the
French women&mdash;the indications of their passing, not
deeds of noble heroism that can be told of foes as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as of friends, but filthy souvenirs of the passing of creatures
for whom the word "barbarism" is too mild!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here is a more spiritual picture.</p>

<p>Robert Le Roux, jun., was buried yesterday. You
will have read in the previous pages here the story of his
exploits on the battlefield&mdash;the closing of his young life in
bravely leading his troops up the hill to certain death.
And yesterday I went to St. Germain to his funeral.</p>

<p>The last time I had seen young Robert he was a little
boy, in short breeches and socks. His mother brought
him to Versailles and he played with us in the garden
there&mdash;a strong, splendid-looking young French boy.
Now I was going to his funeral, and he was engaged to
be married, with all his hopes before him, and on this
same train was his little fiancée, in her long crêpe veil,
broken-hearted; and his little sister, and the father, who
had followed his son's campaign with such ardor and
such tenderness; and his uncle, Dr. D., of whom I spoke
previously&mdash;the splendid sergeant-major whose only son
had just been killed by the enemy. A train of sorrow!&mdash;and
only one of so many, so many.</p>

<p>The church at St. Germain is simple and very old. The
doors were all hung with heavy snow-white cloth, and
before the door stood the funeral car drawn by white
horses, all in white, and instead of melancholy hearse
plumes there were bunches of flags, and over all hung
the November mist enveloping, softening, and there was
a big company of Cuirassiers guarding the road.</p>

<p>We went in, and the church was crowded from the
nave to the doors, and all the nave and the little chapels
were blazing with the lily lights of the candles. It was
all so white and so pure, so effulgent, so starry. There
was an uplift about it, an élan; tragic as it all was, there
was ever that feeling of beyond, beyond!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the altar lay the young man's coffin&mdash;that
leaden coffin that had stood by his father in the fortress
of Toul for three weeks, waiting for the dead. It was
completely covered by the French flag, and the candles
burnt around it.</p>

<p>Beside me was a woman with her husband. She wept
so bitterly through the whole service that my heart was
just wrung for her, and her husband's face, as his red-lidded
eyes stared out in the misty church, was one of
the most tragic things I ever saw. I wept, of course,
and I have not cried very much since the war broke out,
but her grief was too much for me. Finally she turned
to me and said: "Madame, I only had one son, he was
so charming, so good; he has fallen before the enemy,
and I don't know where he is buried!" Just think of it!
There she was, at the funeral of another man's son because
he was a soldier! Link upon link of sorrow and
suffering&mdash;such broken hearts....</p>

<p>The whole service was musical, nothing else but violins
and harps. It was the most beautiful thing I ever heard,
so quiet and so sweet; and that little group touched me
profoundly&mdash;Le Roux with his daughter and the little
fiancée&mdash;and that was all. In that coffin lying under the
flag Bessie had placed at Toul her little silk pillow for the
young soldier's head, and his love-letters in a little packet
lay by his side. Around his arm he had worn a little
ribbon taken from the hair of his sweetheart, and at the
very last when he was dying and the hospital nurse was
about to unknot it&mdash;I don't know why&mdash;the boy put up
his feeble hand to prevent her; of course they buried it
with him, and, as you think of it, you can hear that unknown
voice on the battlefield, that, as the stretcher-bearers
came to look for the wounded, called out: "Take him,
he is engaged to be married; and leave me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, if out of it all arise a better civilization, purer motives,
less greed for money, more humanitarian and unselfish
aims, we can bear it.</p>

<p>I think of America with an ever-increasing love; I
am proud to belong to that young and far-off country, but
if our voice is raised now in encouragement for Belgium,
encouragement for the Allies, and in reprobation of these
acts of dishonorable warfare and cruel barbarism, I shall
love my country more.</p>

<p>How superb the figure of the Belgian king is, standing
there among the remnant of his army, and surrounded by
his destroyed and ruined empire, and the cries of the people
in his ears&mdash;a sublime figure....</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF A SCHOOL TEACHER&mdash;AND A
GARDENER</p>

<p class="center"><i>To Mr. F. B. Van Vorst, N. Y.</i></p>

<p class="right">
Nov. 20th, 1914.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>I wonder, as I sit here, in one of those rare, quiet moments
that fall in a nurse's day, whilst I am preparing my
charts, what they are thinking of in this silent room.</p>

<p>This group is singularly silent. They do not talk from
bed to bed, as some of the more loquacious do. Directly
opposite is one of those fragile bits of humanity that the
violent wind of war has blown, like an unresisting leaf,
into the vortex. Monsieur Gilet is a humble little school
teacher from some humble little village school in a once
peaceful commune, where in another little village school
his humble little wife teaches school as he does. He is
so light and so frail that I can lift him myself with ease.
He has a shrapnel wound in his side and they have not
found the ball. His thin cheeks are scarlet. He is gentleness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and sweetness itself. What has he ever done to
be crucified like this? Monsieur Gilet is not thinking of
his burning wound. He is thinking of the little woman in
the province of Cher. How can she come to see him?
She has no congé. When will she come to see him? For
his life is all there in that war-shattered country. She
has a baby twelve weeks old, born since he went to battle.
That's what he is thinking of. When will she come?</p>

<p>On his right is a superb Arab, with an arm and hand
so broken and so mutilated that it is hard to hold it without
shuddering when the doctors drain it. On his head
I have carefully adjusted a bright yellow flannel fez.
His mild, docile eyes follow the nurse as she does for
him the few little things she can to make him more at
ease. For every service done, he thanks her in a sweet,
soft voice. Just now, when I left him to come over here
and sit down before my table, his eyes filled with tears.
He can say a few words of French. He kisses my hand
with Oriental grace. "Merci, ma mère."</p>

<p>On Monsieur Gilet's left lies a man whose language is
as hard to understand, very nearly, as the Arab's&mdash;almost
unintelligible&mdash;a <i>patois</i> of the Midi. He is a gardener,
used only to the care of plants and flowers. He
is a big, rugged giant, and so strong, and so silent a sufferer
that since his entrance to the hospital he has not
made one murmur or one complaint, or asked one service,
and excepting when spoken to, he never says a word.
Then he gives you a radiant smile and some token of
gratitude. They operated on him to-day. There is shrapnel
in his eye. He will never fully see his gardens again,
and he is so strong and so patient and so able to bear
pain, that they operated on him without anæsthetics, and
he walked to and from the operating room&mdash;a brave, silent,
docile giant, singularly appealing.... He is thinking
of his gardens, trodden out of all semblance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
beauty, for he had been working in the north before the
heel of the barbarian crushed out his flowers for ever and
blotted out his sight.</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE BOYS WHO SING
"TIPPERARY"</p>

<p class="center"><i>To Mr. F. B. Van Vorst, Hackensack, N. J.</i></p>

<p class="right">
Paris, Dec. 4th, 1914.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Frederick</span>,</p>

<p>To-morrow will be my last day at the hospital, as I
start in the evening for Nice, on my way to Rome. I
have lately found myself sole nurse in a ward with nine
men....</p>

<p>It is full of English Tommies, and unless you nurse
them and help those English boys, you don't know what
they are. They are too lovely and too fine for words.
One perfectly fine young fellow has had his leg amputated
at the thigh&mdash;his life ruined for ever. Another is
blind, staring into the visions of his past&mdash;he will never
have anything else to look at again. The chief amusement
of these fellows seems to be watching the funerals,
and they call me to run to the window to see the hearses
covered with the Union Jack or the French flag, and they
find nothing mournful in the processions. One Sunday
afternoon, as I sat there, leaning against a table in the
middle of the room, a few country flowers in a vase near
by&mdash;for Miss Hickman asks for country flowers for
country lads&mdash;I asked them if they wouldn't sing me a
song that I had heard a good deal about but had never
heard sung. "What's that, nurse?" asked the boy without
a leg. "Tipperary"&mdash;for I had never heard it. "Why,
of course we will, won't we, lads?" and he said to his
companion, only nineteen, from some English shire: "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hit the tune." And the boy "hit it," and they sang me
"Tipperary." Before they had finished I had turned
away and walked out into the corridor to hide the way it
made me feel, and I heard it softly through the door as
they finished: "It's a long way to Tipperary." I shall
never hear it again without seeing the picture of that
ward, the country flowers and the country lads, and hearing
the measure of that marching tune....</p>

<p>I have seen Mrs. Vanderbilt constantly. She seems
to be ubiquitous. Wherever there's need, she is to be
found&mdash;whether in the operating-room, the bandaging-room,
or in one of the great wards where she has charge.
I have found her everywhere, just at the right moment:
calm, poised, dignified, capable and sweet. But none of
this expresses the strength that she has been to the
American Ambulance since its foundation&mdash;the heart
and soul of its organization; and her personal gifts to it
have been generous beyond words. I don't know what
we shall do when she finally returns to America. She
animates the whole place with her spirit and her
soul....</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE "MIRACLES" OF THE
BATTLES</p>

<p class="center"><i>Madame Le Roux, New York.</i></p>

<p class="right">
Paris, June 15th, 1915.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bessie</span>,</p>

<p>Lady K. told such a beautiful thing, out at Bridget's,
that I forgot to tell you before. She said that it was
bruited in England that there had been a miracle wrought
when von Kluck's army so unexpectedly turned back from
Paris, which without doubt they could have taken. She
said that it was rumored&mdash;and not only in the ranks, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
among higher men&mdash;that there appeared in the sky a singular
phenomenon, and that the German prisoners bore
witness that a cavalcade like heavenly archers suddenly
filled the heavens and shot down upon the Germans a
rain of deadly darts. As you know, this was long before
the use of any asphyxiating gas or turpinite; but
on the field were found hundreds of Germans, stone dead,
immovable, who had fallen without any apparent cause.
You remember the armies of the old Scriptures that
"the breath of the Lord withered away."</p>

<p>Lady K. said that the rumor that the woods of Compiègne
were full of troops when the Germans made that
famous retreat was absolutely untrue. There were no
troops in the forest, and what they saw were, again, celestial
soldiers.</p>

<p>No doubt these tales come always in the history of
war. But, my dear, how beautiful they are&mdash;how much
more heavenly and inspired than the beatings on the slavish
backs of the German Uhlans, of the half-drunken,
brutish hordes! Everywhere is the same uplifting spirit.
When I speak of Paris being sad, it <i>is</i>; but it is not depressing.
There is a difference. If it were not for the
absence of those I love, I would rather be here than
anywhere. In church on Sunday, the Bishop said that
at one of the services near the firing line, when he asked
the question: "How many of the men here have felt,
since they came out, a stirring in their hearts, an awakening
of the spirit?" as far as he could see, every hand
was raised. And men have gone home to England, without
arms and without legs, maimed for life, and have
been heard to say that in spite of their material anguish
they regretted nothing, for they had found their
souls....</p>

<p>I ought to tell you that all credulous and believing
France thinks that the country is being saved by Jeanne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
d'Arc. You hear them say it everywhere. Just think
of it, in the twentieth century, my dear, when the war is
being fought in the air and under the sea, by machines so
modern that only the latest invention can triumph!
Think of it, and then consider that there remains enough
of spiritual faith to believe that the salvation of a country
comes through prayer.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF COMPTE HENRY DADVISARD</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Molly</span>,
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Mme. de S. told me last night that once during the
last year she had a little spray of blossoms that had been
blessed by the Pope, and in writing to Henry on the field,
she sent him a little bit of green&mdash;a tiny leaf pinned on
a loving letter. When she looked through the uniform
sent back to her, a few days ago, in his pocket was this
little card, all stained with his blood. This card, with
her few loving words, was all he carried on him into
that sacred field. I must not forget the belt he wore
around him, which she had made with her own hands, and
it contained some money and in one of the folds of the
chamois was a prayer that she had written out for him.
The paper was so worn with reading and unfolding and
folding that it was like something used by the years.</p>

<p>All the night before he went to that great battle, he
spent in prayer. His aide told Mme. de S. that he had
not closed his eyes. They say that if he could have been
taken immediately from the field, he would have been
saved, for he bled to death.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>I only suppose that you will be interested in these details
because they mark the going out of such a brilliant
life, and it is the intimate story of one soldier who has
laid down his life, after months and months of fighting
and self-abnegation and loneliness, on that distant field.</p>

<p>From the time he left her in August until his death,
he had never seen any of his family&mdash;not a soul. I want
to tell you the way she said good-bye to him, for I never
knew it until last night. She had expected him to lunch&mdash;imagine!&mdash;and
received the news by telephone that he
was leaving his "quartier" in an hour. She rushed there
to see the Cuirassiers, mounted, in their service uniform,
the helmets all covered with khaki, clattering out of the
yard. She sat in the motor and he came out to her, all
ready to go; and they said good-bye, there in the motor,
he sitting by her side, holding her hands. She said he
looked then like the dead&mdash;so grave. You know he was
a soldier, passionately devoted to his career. He had
made all the African campaign and had an illustrious
record. She says he asked her for her blessing and she
lightly touched the helmet covered with khaki and gave
it him. And neither shed a tear. And he kissed her
good-bye. She never saw him again....</p>

<p>She said that his General told her as follows: "The
night before the engagement, Henry Dadvisard came into
my miserable little shack on the field. He said to me:
'Mon général, just show me on the map where the Germans
are.' A map was hanging on the wall and I indicated
with my finger: '<i>Les Allemands sont là, mon enfant</i>.'
And Dadvisard said: 'Why, is that all there is to
do&mdash;just to go out and attack them there? Why, we'll
be coming back as gaily as if it were from the races!'
He turned to go, saying: '<i>Au revoir</i>, mon général.' But
at the door he paused, and I looked up and saw him and
he said: '<i>Adieu</i>, mon général.' And then I saw in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
eyes a singular look, something like an appeal from one
human soul to another, for a word, a touch, before going
out to that sacrifice. I did not dare to say anything
but what I did say: '<i>Bon courage, mon enfant; bonne
chance!</i>' And he went...."</p>

<p>After telling me this, Mme. de S. took out his watch,
which she carries with her now&mdash;a gold watch, with his
crest upon it&mdash;the one he had carried through all his campaigns,
with the soldier's rough chain hanging from it.
It had stopped at half-past ten; as he had wound it the
night before, the watch had gone on after his heart had
ceased to beat....</p>

<p>The day before Henry left his own company of Cuirassiers
to go into the dangerous and terrible experiences of
the trenches, to take up that duty which ended in his laying
down his life, he gathered his men together and bade
them good-bye. Last night dear Mme. de S. showed me
his soldier's notebook, in which he had written the few
words that he meant to say to his men. I begged her to
let me have them: I give them to you. This address
stands to me as one of the most beautiful things I have
ever read.</p>

<p>General Foch paid him a fine tribute when he mentioned
him in despatches, and this mention of him was
accompanied by the bestowal of the Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>"Henry Dadvisard, warm-hearted and vibrant; a remarkable
leader of men. He asked to be transferred to
the infantry, in order to offer more fully to his country
his admirable military talents. He fell gloriously on the
27th of April, leading an attack at the head of his company."</p>

<p>I went out the other day with Madame Marie to Versailles,
<i>en auto</i>. I wanted to see the little hospital that
Anne Morgan and Bessie Marbury have given out there.
One of their pretty little houses is in the charge of some
gentle-faced sisters of charity, and out in the garden,
with the roses blooming and the sweet-scented hay being
raked in great piles, were sitting a lieutenant, convalescing,
and his <i>commandant</i>, who had come to see him, also
wounded. Both men wore the Legion of Honor on their
breasts. They were talking about the campaign. The
lieutenant wore his <i>képi</i> well down over his face; he was
totally blind for ever, at thirty! His interest in talking
to his superior officer was so great that you can fancy
I only stopped a second to speak to him. There were
great scars on his hands and his face and neck were
scarred too. I heard him say, as I turned to walk away:
"<i>J'aime aussi causer des jours quand nous étions collégiens
à Saint-Cyr. Ces souvenirs sont plus doux.</i>" It
was terribly touching.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Belle</span>,</p>

<p>Mme. de S. is going next week on the cruel and dreadful
mission of disinterring her belovèd dead. She is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
going down into the tomb in Belgium&mdash;if she can get
through&mdash;to take her boy out of the charnel house, where
he is buried under six other coffins. "God has his soul,"
she says; "I only ask his body" ... if she can find it.
She has told no one of her griefs, but to me; and she
bears herself like a woman of twenty-five, gallantly....</p>

<p>There is one gay officer of twenty-nine, and six feet
two. I don't think you'd speak of "little insignificant
Frenchmen" if you could see him! He's superb. One
finger off on the left hand, and the right hand utterly
useless. So we work at that for fifteen minutes, and all
the little group of soldiers linger, because they love him
so&mdash;he's so killing, so witty, so gay. He screams in mock
agony, and laughs and makes the most outrageous jokes;
and when he has gone, one of them says to me: "<i>Il est
adoré par ses hommes, madame; il est si courageux.</i>"
The spirit between men and officers is so beautiful in
the French army. They are all brothers. None of that
lordly, arrogant oppression of the Germans. One of the
soldiers said to me: "<i>Il n'y a pas de grade, maintenant,
madame. Nous sommes tous des hommes qui aiment le
pays.</i>"</p>

<p>And Lieutenant &mdash;&mdash;, of whom I have just been
speaking. I said to him: "Tell me something about the
campaign, monsieur." And he answered: "Oh, madame,
I would like to tell you about the <i>men</i>. They're superb.
I have never seen anything like it. I had to lead a charge
with 156 men into what we all believed was certain death.
Why," he said, "they went like schoolboys&mdash;shouting,
laughing, pushing each other up the parapet.... We
came back nine strong," he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Blake has been magnificent. His operations are
something beyond words. Men came in to me for treatment
and told me that he worked actual miracles with
faces that were blown off, building new jaws, and oh,
Heavens! I don't know what not.</p>

<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF A FRENCH MOTHER AT
MASS</p>

<p class="right">
Paris, July 20th, 1915.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Violet</span>,</p>

<p>I saw a very touching thing the other day in the Madeleine,
where I went to Mass. A woman no longer young,
in the heaviest of crape, came in and sat down and buried
her face in her hands. She shook with suppressed sobs
and terrible weeping. Presently there came in another
worshipper, a stranger to her, and sat down by her side.
He was a splendid-looking officer in full-dress uniform&mdash;a
young man, with a wedding-ring upon his hand&mdash;one
of those permissionnaires home, evidently, for the short
eight days that all the officers are given now&mdash;a hiatus
between the old war and the new. He bent too, praying;
but the weeping of the woman at his side evidently tore
his heart. Presently she lifted her face and wiped her
eyes, and the officer put his hand on hers. And as I
was sitting near, I heard what he said:</p>

<p>"<i>Pauvre madame, pauvre madame!... Ma mère
pleure comme vous.</i>"</p>

<p>She glanced at him, then bent again in prayer. But
when she had finished, before she left her seat, I heard
her say to him:</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur, j'ai beaucoup prié pour vous. Sachez que
vous aves les prières d'une vieille mère a laquelle ne reste
rien au monde.</i>"</p>

<p>He touched her hand again and said:</p>

<p>"Merci, madame. Adieu!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was just one of those intensely touching pictures in
that dimly lighted church, full of worshippers, that one
can never forget....</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Anne</span>,</p>

<p>Wandering about alone, as I have been doing a great
deal lately, I have gone into many of the churches and
prayed at the different shrines, and it is impressive to see
the character of those who come in to pray. Men who
can never kneel again; men who sit with bandaged eyes
before the lighted altars, for whom all the visions of the
world have been blotted out for ever; the poor women in
their little shawls; women in their crape veils; the man
going to the Front; the man who has come back from
it, never to take an active part in life again; and the
women who ask the Mother of Sorrows to remember
theirs....</p>

<p>A very agreeable Abbé dined with me last night. He
told me that he was giving absolution to one dying German
boy&mdash;only sixteen&mdash;on the field, and he put his hand
under the boy's head and lifted it, and the boy, who was
delirious, simply said: "Mama, mama, mama!" And the
Abbé said to me: "It is a very curious thing, but in all
the dying appeals I have ever heard, it is always for the
<i>mother</i>." That return, perhaps, to the lost childhood&mdash;the
call just before going to sleep....</p>

<p>One day when I was giving electricity lately at the
Ambulance, a poor little Zouave hobbled in&mdash;he had only
one leg left&mdash;and held up a maimed hand for me to treat.
He was not a very interesting-looking specimen&mdash;rather
sullen and discouraged, I thought&mdash;but as I looked at his
frail little body and his disfigured hand, I looked at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
breast too. Three medals were on it&mdash;the Legion of
Honor, the Croix de Guerre, and the Médaille Militaire&mdash;all
a man can get! And he was just a little soldier
of Africa&mdash;a nondescript man whose name would only be
heard at other times to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Jacquemin.</p>

<p>"<i>Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait pour mériter tout cela,
mon ami?</i>"</p>

<p><i>Pour mériter tout cela, parbleu!</i> He has one leg only,
one hand only, and he has back of him eight months of
hospital and eight months of horror, for his sufferings
have been beyond words.</p>

<p>Jacquemin!</p>

<p>Oh, his name is pretty well known now in a certain
Sector!</p>

<p>"<i>Qu'est-ce que vous aves fait pour mériter tout cela?</i>"</p>

<p>Three medals across that narrow chest!</p>

<p>Well, alone, on a bad night, in storm and rain, he was
a volunteer patrol. Alone, he brought in four German
prisoners. He was a volunteer for six <i>patrouilles</i> of the
gravest danger&mdash;not always alone, but always fetching in
prisoners and more prisoners. Bad for the Germans.
He carried his superior officer, wounded, out under fire
and saved his life. Then there was a line of trenches
where a hundred and fifty-six men&mdash;they know his name:
Jacquemin! Jacquemin with the little mongrel dog always
at his heels&mdash;a hundred and fifty-six men had eaten
nothing for four days but the sodden bread left in their
haversacks. Jacquemin filled several wagons full of
bread and seating himself on the driver's seat of the first,
he drove in that life-giving line under the fire of shot
and shell, right into the very jaws of death. He brought
sufficient supplies to save the line of trenches, for otherwise
they would have had to evacuate them through starvation,
as indeed was the case with others where this gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
little Zouave could not reach. Just the giving of food
to the faint and hungry men whose stern faces were set
against death. That act brought him one of those medals
across his breast&mdash;I forget which. Finally, the shot and
shell which he had braved so many times was bound to
get him, and with his leg and arm almost shot away he
lay for dead amongst the other slain, and they buried
him. They buried Jacquemin. Fortunately or unfortunately&mdash;it
depends upon how he regards a life which he
will live through henceforth with only one leg and only
one arm&mdash;a little bit of his soldier's coat sprouted out of
the ground. (They don't always bury deep on those
fields.) And his dog saw it and smelled and dug and
dug, and whined and cried, until they came and unburied
Jacquemin and brought him back.</p>

<p>He is sitting up there at the Ambulance now, and his
little dog is sometimes in the kitchen and sometimes comes
up to the wards.</p>

<p>Jacquemin!</p>

<p>"<i>Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait pour mériter tout cela,
mon ami?</i>"</p>

<p>What countless thousands of them have done, all along
those lines&mdash;Englishmen and Frenchmen, Scotchmen and
Irishmen, Indians, Australians, Canadians&mdash;hearts and
souls and bodies offered up magnificently and valiantly
sacrificed for the greatest Cause for which humanity has
ever fought! Jacquemin brought them bread to the fighting
line; and that great fighting line, by its efforts, is giving
bread for ever to the world....</p>

<p>This narrative is without doubt the greatest story yet told by
a German soldier. It is a startling confession of the inward
feelings of a young German miner in the Kaiser's ranks. Escaping
to America after serving fourteen months, he first told
his story to the <i>New Yorker Volkszeitung</i>, the principal organ
of the German socialists in the United States. Believing that
all the American people should know the truth, his experiences
have been translated by J. Koettgen and published in book form
by <i>B. W. Huebsch</i>, of New York. His stories are of historical
value because he tells how he marched into Belgium with the
first German army of invasion; the crossing of the Meuse; the
Battle of the Marne. He also tells the first German story of
the rout and flight of the Teutonic forces from the Marne&mdash;and
his desertion from the "hell" within the German army. In
these pages we can give but ten selected glimpses of the several
hundred stories and scenes which he so graphically describes.</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
I&mdash;STORY OF THE MARCH INTO BELGIUM</p>

<p>At the end of July, 1914, our garrison at Koblenz was
feverishly agitated. Part of our men were seized by an
indescribable enthusiasm, others became subject to a feeling
of great depression. The declaration of war was in
the air. I belonged to those who were depressed. For
I was doing my second year of military service and was
to leave the barracks in six weeks' time. Instead of the
long wished-for return home war was facing me....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>Our sapper battalion, No. 30, had been in feverish
activity five days before the mobilization; work was being
pushed on day and night.... Moreover, there was
the suspicious amiability of the officers and sergeants,
which excluded any doubt that any one might still have
had. Officers who had never before replied to the salute
of a private soldier now did so with the utmost attention.
Cigars and beer were distributed in those days by
the officers with great, uncommon liberality, so that it
was not surprising that many soldiers were scarcely ever
sober and did not realize the seriousness of the situation.
But there were also others. There were soldiers who
also in those times of good-humour and the grinning
comradeship of officer and soldier could not forget that in
military service they had often been degraded to the level
of brutes, and who now thought with bitter feelings that
an opportunity might perhaps be offered in order to
settle accounts.</p>

<p>The order of mobilization became known on the 1st
of August, and the following day was decided upon as
the real day of mobilization. But without awaiting the
arrival of the reserves we left our garrison town on
August 1st. Who was to be our "enemy" we did not
know; Russia was for the present the only country
against which war had been declared.</p>

<p>We marched through the streets of the town to the
station between crowds of people numbering many thousands.
Flowers were thrown at us from every window;
everybody wanted to shake hands with the departing
soldiers. All the people, even soldiers, were weeping.
Many marched arm in arm with their wife or sweetheart.
The music played songs of leave-taking. People cried
and sang at the same time. Entire strangers, men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
women, embraced and kissed each other; men embraced
men and kissed each other. It was a real witches' sabbath
of emotion; like a wild torrent, that emotion carried
away the whole assembled humanity. Nobody, not even
the strongest and most determined spirit, could resist that
ebullition of feeling.</p>

<p>But all that was surpassed by the taking leave at the
station, which we reached after a short march. Here
final adieus had to be said, here the separation had to
take place. I shall never forget that leave-taking, however
old I may grow to be. Desperately many women
clung to their men; some had to be removed by force.
Just as if they had suddenly had a vision of the fate of
their beloved ones, as if they were beholding the silent
graves in foreign lands in which those poor nameless
ones were to be buried, they sought to cling fast to their
possession, to retain what already no longer belonged to
them.</p>

<p>Finally that, too, was over. We had entered a train
that had been kept ready, and had made ourselves comfortable
in our cattle-trucks. Darkness had come, and
we had no light in our comfortable sixth-class carriages.</p>

<p>The train moved slowly down the Rhine, it went along
without any great shaking, and some of us were seized
by a worn-out feeling after those days of great excitement.
Most of the soldiers lay with their heads on their
knapsacks and slept. Others again tried to pierce the
darkness as if attempting to look into the future; still
others drew stealthily a photo out of their breast-pocket,
and only a very small number of us spent the time by
debating our point of destination. Where are we going
to? Well, where? Nobody knew it. At last, after long,
infinitely long hours the train came to a stop. After a
night of quiet, slow riding we were at&mdash;Aix-la-Chapelle!
At Aix-la-Chapelle! What were we doing at Aix-la-Chapelle?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
We did not know, and the officers only
shrugged their shoulders when we asked them.</p>

<p>After a short interval the journey proceeded, and on
the evening of the 2nd of August we reached a farm in
the neighbourhood of the German and Belgian frontier,
near Herbesthal. Here our company was quartered in
a barn. Nobody knew what our business was at the
Belgian frontier. In the afternoon of the 3rd of August
reservists arrived, and our company was brought to its
war strength. We had still no idea concerning the purpose
of our being sent to the Belgian frontier, and that
evening we lay down on our bed of straw with a forced
tranquillity of mind. Something was sure to happen
soon, to deliver us from that oppressive uncertainty.
How few of us thought that for many it would be the
last night to spend on German soil!...</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE FIRST ALARM TO BATTLE</p>

<p>At 1 o'clock in the morning an alarm aroused us again,
and the captain honoured us with an address. He told
us we were at war with Belgium, that we should acquit
ourselves as brave soldiers, earn iron crosses, and do
honour to our German name....</p>

<p>The soldier is told, "The Belgian is your enemy," and
he has to believe it. The soldier, the workman in uniform,
had not known till then who was his enemy. If
they had told us, "The Hollander is your enemy," we
would have believed that, too; we would have been compelled
to believe it, and would have shot him by order.
We, the "German citizens in uniform," must not have
an opinion of our own, must have no thoughts of our
own, for they give us our enemy and our friend according
to requirements, according to the requirements of
their own interests. The Frenchman, the Belgian, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Italian, is your enemy. Never mind, shoot as we order,
and do not bother your head about it....</p>

<p>About ten minutes we might have lain in the grass
when we suddenly heard rifle shots in front of us. Electrified,
all of us jumped up and hastened to our rifles.
Then the firing of rifles that was going on at a distance
of about a mile or a mile and a half began steadily to
increase in volume. We set in motion immediately....</p>

<p>Though I was aware that we should be in the firing
line within half an hour, I endeavoured to convince myself
that our participation in the fight would no longer
be necessary. I clung obstinately, nay, almost convulsively
to every idea that could strengthen that hope or
give me consolation. That not every bullet finds its
billet; that, as we had been told, most wounds in modern
wars were afflicted by grazing shots which caused
slight flesh-wounds; those were some of the reiterated
self-deceptions indulged in against my better knowledge.
And they proved effective. It was not only that they
made me in fact feel more easy; deeply engaged in those
thoughts I had scarcely observed that we were already
quite near the firing line....</p>

<p>We were lying flat on the ground, and fired in the
direction indicated to us as fast as our rifles would
allow. So far we had not seen our opponents. That,
it seemed, was too little interesting to some of our soldiers;
so they rose partly, and fired in a kneeling position.
Two men of my company had to pay for their curiosity
with their lives. Almost at one and the same time
they were shot through the head. The first victim of our
group fell down forward without uttering a sound; the
second threw up his arms and fell on his back. Both of
them were dead instantly.</p>

<p>Who could describe the feelings that overcome a man
in the first hail of bullets he is in? When we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
leaping forward to reach the firing line I felt no longer
any fear and seemed only to try to reach the line as
quickly as possible. But when looking at the first dead
man I was seized by a terrible horror. For minutes
I was perfectly stupefied, had completely lost command
over myself and was absolutely incapable to think or
act. I pressed my face and hands firmly against the
ground, and then suddenly I was seized by an irrepressible
excitement, took hold of my gun, and began to fire
away blindly. Little after little I quieted down again
somewhat, nay, I became almost quite confident as if
everything was normal. Suddenly I found myself content
with myself and my surroundings, and when a little
later the whole line was commanded, "Leap forward!
March, march!" I ran forward demented like the others,
as if things could not be other than what they were....</p>

<p>It was a hand to hand fight; every kind of weapon
had to be employed; the opponent was attacked with
the butt-end of the rifle, the knife, the fist, and the teeth.
One of my best friends fought with a gigantic Belgian;
both had lost their rifles. They were pummeling each
other with their fists. I had just finished with a Belgian
who was about twenty-two years of age, and was going
to assist my friend, as the Herculean Belgian was so
much stronger than he. Suddenly my friend succeeded
with a lightning motion in biting the Belgian in the chin.
He bit so deeply that he tore away a piece of flesh with
his teeth. The pain the Belgian felt must have been
immense, for he let go his hold and ran off screaming
with terrible pain.</p>

<p>All that happened in seconds. The blood of the Belgian
ran out of my friend's mouth; he was seized by a
horrible nausea, an indescribable terror, the taste of the
warm blood nearly drove him insane. That young, gay,
lively fellow of twenty-four had been cheated out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
youth in that night. He used to be the jolliest among us;
after that we could never induce him even to smile.</p>

<p>Whilst fighting during the night I came for the first
time in touch with the butt-end of a Belgian rifle. I
had a hand to hand fight with a Belgian when another
one from behind hit me with his rifle on the head with
such force that it drove my head into the helmet up to
my ears. I experienced a terrific pain all over my head,
doubled up, and lost consciousness. When I revived I
found myself with a bandaged head in a barn among
other wounded.</p>

<p>I had not been severely wounded, but I felt as if my
head was double its normal size, and there was a noise
in my ears as of the wheels of an express engine....</p>

<p>We were quite hungry and ate the tinned soup with
the heartiest of appetites. Many of our soldiers were
sitting with their dinner-pails on the dead horses that
were lying about, and were eating with such pleasure
and heartiness as if they were home at mother's. Nor
did some corpses in the neighbourhood of our improvised
camp disturb us. There was only a lack of water and
after having eaten thirst began to torment us.</p>

<p>We continued our march in the scorching midday sun;
dust was covering our uniforms and skin to the depth of
almost an inch. We tried in vain to be jolly, but thirst
tormented us more and more, and we became weaker and
weaker from one quarter of an hour to another. Many
in our ranks fell down exhausted....</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE POISONED WELLS</p>

<p>Finally, towards four o'clock, we saw a village in
front of us; we began at once to march at a much brisker
pace. Among other things we saw a farm-cart on which
were several civilian prisoners, apparently snipers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
There was also a Catholic priest among them who had,
like the others, his hands tied behind his back with a
rope. Curiosity prompted us to enquire what he had
been up to, and we heard that he had incited the farmers
of the village to poison the water.</p>

<p>We soon reached the village and the first well at which
we hoped to quench our thirst thoroughly. But that was
no easy matter, for a military guard had been placed
before it who scared us off with the warning,
"Poisoned"! Disappointed and terribly embittered the
soldiers, half dead with thirst, gnashed their teeth; they
hurried to the next well, but everywhere the same devilish
thing occurred&mdash;the guard preventing them from
drinking. In a square, in the middle of the village, there
was a large village well which sent, through two tubes,
water as clear as crystal into a large trough. Five soldiers
were guarding it and had to watch that nobody
drank of the poisoned water. I was just going to march
past it with my pal when suddenly the second, larger
portion of our company rushed like madmen to the well.
The guards were carried away by the rush, and every
one now began to drink the water with the avidity of an
animal. All quenched their thirst, and not one of us
became ill or died. We heard later on that the priest had
to pay for it with his death....</p>

<p>In every army one finds men with the disposition of
barbarians. The many millions of inhabitants in Germany
or France are not all civilized people, much as we
like to convince ourselves of the contrary. Compulsory
military service in those countries forces all without distinction
into the army, men and monsters. I have often
bitterly resented the wrong one did to our army in calling
us all barbarians only because among us&mdash;as, naturally
also among the French and English&mdash;there were to be
found elements that really ought to be in the penitentiary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
I will only cite one example of how we soldiers ourselves
punished a wretch whom we caught committing a
crime.</p>

<p>One evening&mdash;it was dark already&mdash;we reached a small
village to the east of the town of Bertrix, and there, too,
found "poisoned" water. We halted in the middle of the
village. I was standing before a house with a low window,
through which one could see the interior. In the
miserable poverty-stricken working man's dwelling we
observed a woman who clung to her children as if afraid
they would be torn from her. Though we felt very bitter
on account of the want of water, every one of us would
have liked to help the poor woman. Some of us were
just going to sacrifice our little store of victuals and to
say a few comforting words to the woman, when all at
once a stone as big as a fist was thrown through the
window-pane into the room and hurt a little girl in the
right hand. There were sincere cries of indignation,
but at the same moment twenty hands at least laid hold
of the wretch, a reservist of our company, and gave him
such a hiding as to make him almost unconscious. If
officers and other men had not interfered the fellow
would have been lynched there and then. He was to be
placed before a court-martial later on, but it never came
to that. He was drowned in the river at the battle of
the Meuse. Many soldiers believed he drowned himself,
because he was not only shunned by his fellow soldiers,
but was also openly despised by them....</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE BELGIAN SNIPERS</p>

<p>We had to proceed, and soon reached the town of
Bertrix. Some few houses to the left and right of the
road were burning fiercely; we soon got to know that
they had been set alight because soldiers marching past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
were said to have been shot at from those houses. Before
one of these houses a man and his wife and their
son, a boy of 15 or 16, lay half burnt to cinders; all had
been covered with straw. Three more civilians lay dead
in the same street.</p>

<p>We had marched past some more houses when all at
once shots rang out; they had been shooting from some
house, and four of our soldiers had been wounded. For
a short while there was confusion. The house from
which the shots must have come was soon surrounded,
and hand grenades were thrown through all the windows
into the interior. In an instant all the rooms were in
flames. The exploding hand grenades caused such an
enormous air pressure that all the doors were blown
from their hinges and the inner walls torn to shreds.
Almost at the same time, five men in civilian clothes
rushed into the street and asked for quarter with uplifted
hands. They were seized immediately and taken
to the officers, who formed themselves into a tribunal
within a few minutes. Ten minutes later sentence had
already been executed; five strong men lay on the
ground, blindfolded and their bodies riddled by bullets.</p>

<p>Six of us had in each of the five cases to execute the
sentence, and unfortunately I, too, belonged to those
thirty men. The condemned man whom my party of
six had to shoot was a tall, lean man, about forty years
of age. He did not wince for a moment when they
blindfolded him. In a garden of a house nearby he was
placed with his back against the house, and after our
captain had told us that it was our duty to aim well
so as to end the tragedy quickly, we took up our position
six paces from the condemned one. The sergeant commanding
us had told us before to shoot the condemned
man through the chest. We then formed two lines, one
behind the other. The command was given to load and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
secure, and we pushed five cartridges into the rifle. Then
the command rang out, "Get ready!" The first line
knelt, the second stood up. We held our rifles in such
a position that the barrel pointed in front of us whilst
the butt-end rested somewhere near the hip. At the
command, "Aim!" we slowly brought our rifles into
shooting position, grasped them firmly, pressed the plate
of the butt-end against the shoulder and, with our cheek
on the butt-end, we clung convulsively to the neck of the
rifle. Our right forefinger was on the trigger, the sergeant
gave us about half a minute for aiming before
commanding, "Fire!"</p>

<p>Even to-day I cannot say whether our victim fell dead
on the spot or how many of the six bullets hit him....</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF MURDEROUS FIGHTS IN THE
NIGHT</p>

<p>After a short march we engaged the French to the
northeast of Donchéry. On this side of the Meuse the
enemy had only his rear-guard, whose task was to cover
the crossing of the main French armies, a movement
which was almost exclusively effected at Sedan and Donchéry.
We stuck close to the heels of our opponents,
who did not retreat completely till darkness began to
fall. The few bridges left did not allow him to withdraw
his forces altogether as quickly as his interest demanded.
Thus it came about that an uncommonly murderous
nocturnal street fight took place in Donchéry
which was burning at every corner. The French fought
with immense energy; an awful slaughter was the result.
Man against man! That "man against man!" is the most
terrible thing I have experienced in war. Nobody can
tell afterwards how many he has killed. You have
gripped your opponent, who is sometimes weaker, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
stronger than yourself. In the light of the burning
houses you observe that the white of his eyes has turned
red; his mouth is covered with a thick froth. With head
uncovered, with disheveled hair, the uniform unbuttoned
and mostly ragged, you stab, hew, scratch, bite and strike
about you like a wild animal. It means life or death.
You fight for your life. No quarter is given. You only
hear the gasping, groaning, jerky breathing. You only
think of your own life, of death, of home. In feverish
haste, as in a whirlwind, old memories are rushing
through your mind. Yet you get more excited from minute
to minute, for exhaustion tries to master you; but
that must not be&mdash;not now! And again the fight is renewed;
again there is hewing, stabbing, biting. Without
rifle, without any weapon in a life and death struggle.
You or I. I? I?&mdash;Never! you! The exertion becomes
superhuman. Now a thrust, a vicious bite, and you are
the victor. Victor for the moment, for already the next
man, who has just finished off one of your mates, is upon
you&mdash;. You suddenly remember that you have a dagger
about you. After a hasty fumbling you find it in the prescribed
place. A swift movement and the dagger buries
itself deeply in the body of the other man.</p>

<p>Onward! onward! new enemies are coming up, real
enemies. How clearly the thought suddenly flashes on
you that that man is your enemy, that he is seeking to
take your life, that he bites, strikes, and scratches, tries
to force you down and plant his dagger in your heart.
Again you use your dagger. Thank heavens! He is
down. Saved!&mdash; Still, you must have that dagger
back! You pull it out of his chest. A jet of warm
blood rushes out of the gaping wound and strikes your
face. Human blood, warm human blood! You shake
yourself, horror strikes you for only a few seconds.
The next one approaches; again you have to defend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
your skin. Again and again the mad murdering is repeated,
all night long&mdash;....</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF THE MEN WHO DIE</p>

<p>Many of my mates envied the dead soldiers and wished
to be in their place in order to be at least through with
all their misery. Yet all of us were afraid of dying&mdash;afraid
of dying, be it noted, not of death. All of us
often longed for death, but we were horrified at the slow
dying lasting hours which is the rule on the battlefield,
that process which makes the wounded, abandoned soldier
die piecemeal. I have witnessed the death of hundreds
of young men in their prime, but I know of none among
them who died willingly. A young sapper of the name
of Kellner, whose home was at Cologne, had his whole
abdomen ripped open by a shell splinter. Maddened by
pain he begged me to assure him that he would not have
to die. Of course, I assured him that his wounds were
by no means severe and that the doctor would be there
immediately to help him. My words comforted him. He
died ten minutes later....</p>

<p>We common soldiers were here handling the dead and
wounded as if we had never done anything else, and yet
in our civilian lives most of us had an abhorrence and
fear of the dead and the horribly mangled. War is a
hard schoolmaster who bends and reshapes his pupils.</p>

<p>One section was busy with digging a common grave
for the dead. We took away the papers and valuables of
the dead, took possession of the eatable and drinkable
stores to be found in the saddle bags attached to the
horses and, when the grave was ready, we began to place
the dead bodies in it. They were laid close together in
order to utilize fully the available space. I, too, had been
ordered to "bring in" the dead. The bottom of the grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was large enough for twenty-three bodies if the space
was well utilized. When two layers of twenty-three had
already been buried a sergeant of the artillery, who was
standing near, observed that one of the "dead" was still
alive. He had seen the "corpse" move the fingers of his
right hand. On closer examination it turned out that we
came near burying a living man, for after an attempt lasting
two hours we succeeded in restoring him to consciousness.
The officer of the infantry who supervised the
work now turned to the two soldiers charged with getting
the corpses ready and asked them whether they were
sure that all the men buried were really dead.</p>

<p>"Yes," the two replied, "we suppose they are all dead."
That seemed to be quite sufficient for that humane officer,
for he ordered the interments to proceed. Nobody
doubted that there were several more among the 138 men
whom we alone buried in one grave (two other, still bigger,
graves had been dug by different burial parties) from
whose bodies life had not entirely flown....</p>

<p>We were as merry as boys and as noisy as street urchins.
"Oh, what a joy to be a soldier lad!"&mdash;that song
rang out, subdued at first, then louder and louder. It
died away quickly enough as one after the other laid down
his tired head. We slept like the dead.</p>

<p>A soldier in war never knows the date or day of the
week. One day is like another. Whether it is Saturday,
Thursday or Sunday, it means always the same routine
of murdering. "Remember the Sabbath day to keep
it holy!" "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work.
But the seventh day&mdash;thou shalt not do any work."
These, to our Christian rulers, are empty phrases. "Six
days shalt thou murder and on the seventh day, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF THE "MISSING" OFFICERS</p>

<p>However, not all the soldiers approved of that senseless,
that criminal murdering. Some of the "gentlemen"
who had ordered us to massacre our French comrades
were killed "by mistake" in the darkness of the night,
by their own people, of course. Such "mistakes" repeat
themselves almost daily, and if I keep silence with regard
to many such mistakes which I could relate, giving the
exact name and place, the reader will know why.</p>

<p>During that night it was a captain and first lieutenant
who met this fate. An infantryman who was serving his
second year stabbed the captain through the stomach
with his bayonet, and almost at the same time the first
lieutenant got a stab in the back. Both men were dead
in a few minutes. Those that did the deeds showed not
the slightest signs of repentance, and not one of us felt
inclined to reproach them; on the contrary, every one
knew that despicable, brutal murderers had met their
doom.</p>

<p>In this connection I must mention a certain incident
which necessitates my jumping a little ahead of events.
When on the following day I conversed with a mate from
my company and asked him for the loan of his pocket
knife he drew from his pocket three cartridges besides
his knife. I was surprised to find him carrying cartridges
in his trousers' pockets and asked him whether he had no
room for them in his cartridge case. "There's room
enough," he replied, "but those three are meant for a
particular purpose; there's a name inscribed on each of
them." Some time after&mdash;we had meanwhile become fast
friends&mdash;I inquired again after the three bullets. He
had one of them left. I reflected and remembered two
sergeants who had treated us like brutes in times of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
peace, whom we had hated as one could only hate slave-drivers.
They had found their grave in French soil....</p>

<p>A company of the Hessian landwehr, all of them old
soldiers, were marching past with sore feet and drooping
heads. They had probably marched for a long while.
Officers were attempting to liven them up. They were
to sing a song, but the Hessians, fond of singing and
good-natured as they certainly are known to be, were by
no means in a mood to sing. "I tell you to sing, you
swine!" the officer cried, and the pitifully helpless-looking
"swine" endeavored to obey the command. Here and
there a thin voice from the ranks of the overtired men
could be heard to sing, "<i>Deutschland, Deutschland über
alles, über alles in der Welt</i>." With sore feet and broken
energy, full of disgust with their "glorious" trade of
warriors, they sang that symphony of supergermanism
that sounded then like blasphemy, nay, like a travesty&mdash;"<i>Deutschland,
Deutschland über alles, über alles in der
Welt</i>." ...</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF THE SACKING OF SUIPPES</p>

<p>I have never in war witnessed a greater general pillaging
than here in Suippes. It was plain that we had to
live and had to have food. The inhabitants and storekeepers
having fled, it was often impossible to pay for
the things one needed. Men simply went into some store,
put on socks and underwear, and left their old things;
they then went to some other store, took the food they
fancied, and hied themselves to a wine-cellar to provide
themselves to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>The finest and largest stores&mdash;Suippes supplied a large
tract of country and had comparatively extensive stores
of all descriptions&mdash;were empty shells in a few hours.</p>

<p>One of our sappers had for weeks carried about with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
him a pair of handsome boots for his fiancée and then
had them sent to her in two parcels. However, the field post
did not guarantee delivery; and thus the war bride
got the left boot, and not the right one....</p>

<p>The occupant of one house was evidently a young
bride, for the various pieces of the trousseau, trimmed
with dainty blue ribbons, could be seen in the wardrobes
in a painfully spick and span condition. All the wardrobes
were unlocked. We did not touch a thing. We
were again reminded of the cruelty of war. Millions
it turned into beggars in one night; the fondest hopes
and desires were destroyed. When, the next morning,
we entered the house again, driven by a presentiment of
misfortune, we found everything completely destroyed.
Real barbarians had been raging here, who had lost that
thin varnish with which civilization covers the brute in
man. The whole trousseau of the young bride had been
dragged from the shelves and was still partly covering
the floor. Portraits, photographs, looking-glasses, all lay
broken on the floor. Three of us had entered the room,
and all three of us clenched our fists in helpless rage....</p>

<p>When a man is accustomed to step over corpses with a
cold smile on his lips, when he has to face death every
minute day and night, he gradually loses that finer feeling
for human things and humanity. Thus it must not
surprise one that soldiers could laugh and joke in the
midst of awful devastation, that they brought wine to a
concert room in which there was a piano and an electric
organ, and had a joyful time with music and wine. They
drank till they were unconscious; they drank with sergeants
and corporals, pledging "brotherhood"; and they
rolled arm in arm through the streets with their new
"comrades."...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<p>IX&mdash;STORY OF THE TRAGEDY OF THE MARNE</p>

<p><i>At the Marne&mdash;in the maw of death.</i> It was dark, and
rained. From all directions one heard in the darkness
the wounded calling, crying, and moaning. The wounded
we had with us were likewise moaning and crying. All
wanted to have their wounds dressed, but we had no
more bandages. We tore off pieces of our dirty shirts
and placed the rags on those sickening wounds. Men
were dying one after the other. There were no doctors,
no bandages; we had nothing whatever. You had
to help the wounded and keep the French off at the same
time. It was an unbearable, impossible state of things.
It rained harder and harder. We were wet to our skins.
We fired blindly into the darkness. The rolling fire of
rifles increased, then died away, then increased again.
We sappers were placed among the infantry. My neighbor
gave me a dig in the ribs. "I say," he called out.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"A sapper."</p>

<p>"Come here," he hissed. "It gives you an uncanny
feeling to be alone in this hell of a night. Why are you
here too?&mdash;They'll soon come again, those over there;
then there'll be fine fun again. Do you hear the others
cry?"</p>

<p>He laughed. Suddenly he began again: "I always
shoot at those until they leave off crying&mdash;that's great
fun."</p>

<p>Again he laughed, that time more shrilly than before.</p>

<p>I knew what was the matter. He had become insane.
A man passed with ammunition. I begged him to go
at once and fetch the section leader. The leader, a lieutenant
of the infantry, came up. I went to meet him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and told him that my neighbor was continually firing at
the wounded, was talking nonsense, and was probably insane.
The lieutenant placed himself between us. "Can
you see anything?" he asked the other man. "What?
See? No; but I hear them moaning and crying, and as
soon as I hit one&mdash;well, he is quiet, he goes to sleep&mdash;"
The lieutenant nodded at me. He took the gun away
from the man. But the latter snatched it quickly away
again and jumped out of the trench. From there he fired
into the crowd of wounded men until, a few seconds
after, he dropped down riddled by several bullets.</p>

<p>(Here the soldier gives a wonderful description of
the rout and flight from the Battle of the Marne which
is too long to be included in this collection, but which
the reader will find complete, in his book: "A Deserter's
War Experiences."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>


<p>X&mdash;STORY OF A FURLOUGH&mdash;AND ESCAPE</p>

<p>It was not until September that I managed to obtain
furlough at the request of my relations, and I left for
home with a resolve that at times seemed to me impossible
to execute. All went well until I got to Diedenhofen.</p>

<p>As far as that station the railroads are operated by
the army authorities. At Diedenhofen they are taken
over by the Imperial Railroads of Alsace-Lorraine and
the Prusso-Hessian State Railroads. So I had to change,
and got on a train that went to Saarbruecken. I had
scarcely taken a seat in a compartment in my dirty and
ragged uniform when a conductor came along to inspect
the tickets. Of course, I had no ticket; I had only a
furlough certificate and a pass which had been handed
to me at the field railroad depot of Chatel. The conductor
looked at the papers and asked me again for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
ticket. I drew his attention to my pass. "That is only
good for the territory of the war operations," he said;
"you are now traveling on a state railroad and have to
buy a ticket."</p>

<p>I told him that I should not buy a ticket, and asked
him to inform the station manager. "You," I told him,
"only act according to instructions. I am not angry
with you for asking of me what I shall do under no circumstances."
He went off and came back with the manager.
The latter also inspected my papers and told me
I had to pay for the journey.</p>

<p>"I have no means for that purpose," I told him. "For
these last three years I have been in these clothes" (I
pointed to my uniform), "and for three years I have
therefore been without any income. Whence am I to get
the money to pay for this journey?"</p>

<p>"If you have no money for traveling you can't take
furlough." I thought to myself that if they took me deep
into France they were in conscience bound to take me
back to where they had fetched me. Was I to be a soldier
for three years and fight for the Fatherland for
more than a year only to find that now they refused the
free use of their railroads to a ragged soldier? I explained
that I was not going to pay, that I could not save
the fare from the few pfennigs' pay. I refused explicitly
to pay a soldier's journey with my private money, even
if&mdash;as was the case here&mdash;that soldier was myself. Finally
I told him, "I must request you to inform the military
railroad commander; the depot command attends to
soldiers, not you." He sent me a furious look through
his horn spectacles and disappeared. Two civilians were
sitting in the same compartment with me; they thought
it an unheard-of thing that a soldier coming from the
front should be asked for his fare. Presently the depot
commander came up with a sergeant. He demanded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
see my furlough certificate, pay books, and all my other
papers.</p>

<p>"Have you any money?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"From Chatel in the Argonnes."</p>

<p>"How long were you at the front?"</p>

<p>"In the fourteenth month."</p>

<p>"Been wounded?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have you no money at all?"</p>

<p>"No; you don't want money at the front."</p>

<p>"The fare must be paid. If you can't, the company
must pay. Please sign this paper."</p>

<p>I signed it without looking at it. It was all one to me
what I signed, as long as they left me alone. Then the
sergeant came back.</p>

<p>"You can not travel in that compartment; you must
also not converse with travelers. You have to take the
first carriage marked 'Only for the military.' Get into
that."</p>

<p>"I see," I observed; "in the dogs' compartment."</p>

<p>He turned round again and said, "Cut out those remarks."</p>

<p>The train started, and I arrived safely home. After
the first hours of meeting all at home again had passed
I found myself provided with faultless underwear and
had taken the urgently needed bath. Once more I could
put on the civilian dress I had missed for so long a time.
All of it appeared strange to me. I began to think.
Under no conditions was I going to return to the front.
But I did not know how I should succeed in getting across
the frontier. I could choose between two countries only&mdash;Switzerland
and Holland. It was no use going to
Switzerland, for that country was surrounded by belligerent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
states, and it needed only a little spark to bring
Switzerland into the war, and then there would be no
loophole for me. There was only the nearest country
left for me to choose&mdash;Holland. But how was I to get
there? There was the rub. I concocted a thousand plans
and discarded them again. Nobody, not even my relatives,
must know about it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The eye-witness stories of this gifted English author lay bare
the soul of the Great War. He tells of the human and psychological
side of warfare as he has seen it on the battle field
under heavy shell fire, in bombarded towns, in field hospitals
and amid great movements of troops. He reveals the throbbing
heart of the ghastly brute force that mangles the body and tortures
the mind of heroic men. The author says in his conclusion:
"More passionate than any other emotion that has stirred
man through life is my conviction that any man that has seen
these things, if he has ... any human pity, should dedicate his
head and heart to the sacred duty of preventing another war
like this." The stories herein given are by permission of his
publishers, <i>Robert M. McBride and Company</i> (Copyright 1915),

I&mdash;STORY OF THE SOLDIERS OF FRANCE</p>

<p>The Germans, however great their army, could never
have captured the soul of Paris....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>When in the first days of the war I saw the soldiers
of France on their way to the front, I had even then a
conviction that the fighting qualities of the nation had
not degenerated in forty-four years of peace.... Afterwards,
during many months as a wanderer in this war, I
came to know the French soldier with the intimacy of
long conversations to the sound of guns, in the first line
of trenches facing the enemy, in hospitals, where he
spoke quietly while comrades snored themselves to death,
in villages smashed to pieces by shell-fire, in troop trains
overcrowded with wounded, in woods and fields pockmarked
by the holes of "marmites," and in the restaurants
of Paris and provincial towns where, with an empty
sleeve or one trouser-leg dangling beneath the tablecloth,
he told me his experiences of war with a candor in which
there was no concealment of truth; and out of all these
friendships and revelations of soul the character of the
soldiers of France stands before my mind in heroic
colors....</p>

<p>He does not like death&mdash;he dreads the thought of it&mdash;but
without questioning his soul he springs forward to
save this mother-country of his and dies upon her bosom
with a cry of "Vive la France!"</p>

<p>The French soldier ... needs feminine consolation,
and all his ideals and his yearnings and his self-pity are
intimately associated with the love of women, and especially
of one woman&mdash;his mother. When Napoleon, in
the island of St. Helena, used to talk about the glories
of his victorious years, and then brooded over the tragedy
of his overthrow so that all his soul was clouded
with despair, he used to rouse himself after the silence
which followed those hours of self-analysis and say,
"Let us talk about women&mdash;and love." Always it is the
feminine spirit in which a Frenchman bathes his wounds.
One small incident I saw a year or two ago gave me the
clue to this quality in the French character. It was when
Védrines, the famous airman, was beaten by only a few
minutes in the flight round England. Capitaine Conneau&mdash;"Beaumont,"
as he called himself&mdash;had outraced his
rival and waited, with French gallantry, to shake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
hand of the adversary he had defeated on untiring wings.
A great crowd of smart men and women waited also
at Brooklands to cheer the second in the race, who in
England is always more popular than the prize-winner.
But when Védrines came to earth out of a blue sky he
was savage and bitter. The loss of the prize-money was
a great tragedy to this mechanic who had staked all his
ambition on the flight. He shouted out harsh words
to those who came to cheer him, and shook them off
violently when they tried to clap him on the back. He
was savagely angry. Then suddenly something seemed
to break in his spirit, and his face quivered.</p>

<p>"Is there any woman to embrace me?" he asked. Out
of the crowd came a pretty Frenchwoman and, understanding
the man, though she had not met him before,
she held out her arms to him and raised her face.</p>

<p>"Allons-donc, mon vieux!" she said.</p>

<p>The man put his arms about her and kissed her, while
tears streamed down his face, covered in sweat and dust.
He was comforted, like a boy who had hurt himself, in
his mother's arms. It was a queer little episode&mdash;utterly
impossible in the imagination of an Englishman&mdash;but a
natural thing in France.</p>

<p>So when a Frenchman lies dying, almost unconscious
before the last breath, it is always a woman's name that
he cries out, or whispers, though not always the name of
his wife or mistress. One word is heard again and
again in the hospital wards, where the <i>poilus</i> lie, those
bearded fellows, so strong when they went out to the
war, but now so weak and helpless before death.</p>

<p>"Maman! Maman!"</p>

<p>It is to the bosom of motherhood that the spirit of the
Frenchman goes in that last hour.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear little mamma," writes a young lieutenant
of artillery, "it would be nice to be in my own room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
again, where your picture hangs over my bed looking
down on the white pillows upon which you used to make
the sign of the Cross before I went to sleep. I often
try to dream myself into that bedroom again, but the cold
is too intense for dreams, and another shell comes
shrieking overhead. War is nothing but misery, after
all."</p>

<p>Yet if the English reader imagines that because this
thread of sentiment runs through the character of France
there is a softness in the qualities of French soldiers, he
does not know the truth. Those men whom I saw at the
front and behind the fighting lines were as hard in moral
and spiritual strength as in physical endurance....</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE FIGHTERS FROM
ARGONNE AND LORRAINE</p>

<p>The slopes of Hartmansweilerkopf were already
washed by waves of blood which surged round it for
nine months and more, until its final capture by the
French. St. Mihiel and Les Eparges and the triangle
which the Germans had wedged between the French
lines were a shambles before the leaves had fallen from
the autumn trees in the first year of war. In the country
of the Argonne men fought like wolves and began a
guerrilla warfare with smaller bodies of men, fighting
from wood to wood, from village to village, the forces on
each side being scattered over a wide area in advance
of their main lines. Then they dug themselves into
trenches from which they came out at night, creeping up
to each other's lines, flinging themselves upon each other
with bayonets and butt-ends, killing each other as beasts
kill, without pity and in the mad rage of terror which is
the fiercest kind of courage.</p>

<p>In Lorraine the tide of war ebbed and flowed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the same tracts of ground, and neither side picked up its
dead or its wounded. Men lay there alive for days and
nights, bleeding slowly to death. The hot sun glared
down upon them and made them mad with thirst. Some
of them lay there for as long as three weeks, still alive,
with gangrened limbs in which lice crawled, so that they
stank abominably.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you all the things I saw," said one of the
young soldiers who talked to me on his way back from
Lorraine. He had a queer look in his eyes when he
spoke those words which he tried to hide from me by
turning his head away. But he told me how the fields
were littered with dead, decomposing and swarmed with
flies, lying there in huddled postures, yet some of them
so placed that their fixed eyes seemed to be staring at
the corpses near them. And he told me how on the night
he had his own wound French and German soldiers not
yet dead talked together by the light of the moon, which
shed its pale light upon all those prostrate men, making
their faces look very white. He heard the murmurs of
voices about him, and the groans of the dying, rising to
hideous anguish as men were tortured by ghastly wounds
and broken limbs. In that night enmity was forgotten
by those who had fought like beasts and now lay together.
A French soldier gave his water-bottle to a
German officer who was crying out with thirst. The
German sipped a little and then kissed the hand of the
man who had been his enemy. "There will be no war on
the other side," he said.</p>

<p>Another Frenchman&mdash;who came from Montmartre&mdash;found
lying within a yard of him a Luxembourgeois
whom he had known as his <i>chasseur</i> in a big hotel in
Paris. The young German wept to see his old acquaintance.
"It is stupid," he said, "this war. You and I were
happy when we were good friends in Paris. Why should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
we have been made to fight each other?" He died with
his arms round the neck of the soldier who told me the
story, unashamed of his own tears.</p>

<p>Round this man's neck also were clasped the arms of
a German officer when a week previously the French
<i>piou-piou</i> went across the field of a battle&mdash;one of the
innumerable skirmishes&mdash;which had been fought and won
four days before another French retirement. The young
German had had both legs broken by a shell, and was
wounded in other places. He had strength enough to
groan piteously, but when my friend lifted him up death
was near to him.</p>

<p>"He was all rotten," said the soldier, "and there came
such a terrible stench from him that I nearly dropped
him, and vomited as I carried him along."</p>

<p>I learned something of the psychology of the French
soldier from this young infantryman with whom I traveled
in a train full of wounded soon after that night in
Lorraine, when the moon had looked down on the field of
the dead and dying in which he lay with a broken leg.
He had passed through a great ordeal, so that his nerves
were still torn and quivering, and I think he was afraid
of going mad at the memory of the things he had seen
and suffered, because he tried to compel himself to talk
of trivial things, such as the beauty of the flowers growing
on the railway banks and the different badges on
English uniforms. But suddenly he would go back to
the tale of his fighting in Lorraine and resume a long
and rapid monologue in which little pictures of horror
flashed after each other as though his brain were a
cinematograph recording some melodrama. Queer bits
of philosophy jerked out between this narrative. "This
war is only endurable because it is for a final peace in
Europe." "Men will refuse to suffer these things again.
It is the end of militarism." "If I thought that a child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of mine would have to go through all that I have suffered
during these last weeks, I would strangle him in
his cradle to save him from it."</p>

<p>Sometimes he spoke of France with a kind of religion
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course, I am ready to die for France. She can
demand my life as a right. I belong to her and she can
do with me what she likes. It's my duty to fight in her
defense, and although I tell you all the worst of war,
Monsieur, I do not mean that I am not glad to have
done my part. In a few weeks this wound of mine will
be healed and I shall go back, for the sake of France, to
that Hell again. It is Hell, <i>quand même</i>!"</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORIES OF THE FRENCH ZOUAVES</p>

<p>Some of the letters from French soldiers, scrawled in
the squalor of the trenches by men caked in filth and
mud, are human documents in which they reveal themselves
with extraordinary intimacy, and in which they put
the whole truth, not disguising their terror or their blood-lust
in the savage madness of a bayonet charge, or the
heartache which comes to them when they think of the
woman they love, or the queer little emotions and sentiments
which come to them in the grim business of
war....</p>

<p>"I send this letter," writes a young Zouave, "as I sit
huddled under an earth-heap at twenty yards from a
German trench, less to be envied than a rabbit in its
burrow, because when the hunter is far away it can
come out and feed at pleasure. You who live through
the same agonies, old friend, must learn and rejoice that
I have been promoted adjutant on the night of November
13 on the banks of the Yser. There were seventy men
out of 250&mdash;the rest of the company sleep forever round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that ferryman's house which the papers have made famous....
What moral sufferings I have endured! We
have now been brought to the south of Ypres and continue
this depressing life in advanced trenches. Not a
quarter of an hour's respite; shells, shrapnels, bombs and
bullets fall around us continuously. How courage has
changed with this modern war! The hero of olden times
was of a special type, who put on a fine poise and played
up to the gallery because he fought before admiring spectators.
Now, apart from our night attacks, always murderous,
in which courage is not to be seen, because one
can hardly discern one's neighbour in the darkness, our
valour consists in a perfect stoicism. Just now I had a
fellow killed before a loophole. His comrades dragged
him away, and with perfect quietude replaced the man
who is eternally out of action. Isn't that strange? Isn't
it courage to get the brains of one's comrade full in the
face, and then to stand on guard in the same place while
suffering the extremes of cold and dampness?... On
the night of the 13th I commanded a section of corps
which a mitrailleuse had raked. I had the luck to escape,
and I shouted to these poor devils to make a last assault.
Then I saw what had happened and found myself with a
broken rifle and a uniform in rags and tatters. My commandant
spoke to me that night, and said: 'You had
better change those clothes. You can put on an adjutant's
stripes.'"...</p>

<p>"The greater number of the bodies," writes a soldier,
"still lie between the trenches, and we have been unable
to withdraw them. We can see them always, in frightful
quantity, some of them intact, others torn to bits by the
shells which continue to fall upon them. The stench of
this corruption floats down upon us with foul odours.
Bits of their rotting carcasses are flung into our faces
and over our heads as new shells burst and scatter them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
It is like living in a charnel house where devils are at
play flinging dead men's flesh at living men, with fiendish
mockery. The smell of this corruption taints our food,
and taints our very souls, so that we are spiritually and
physically sick. That is war!"</p>

<p>"This horrible game of war," writes another man,
"goes on passionately in our corner. In seventy-four
days we have 'progressed' about 1200 yards. That tells
you everything. Ground is gained, so to speak, by the
inch, and we all know now how much it costs to get back
a bit of free France."</p>

<p>Along the French lines Death did not rest from his
harvesting whatever the weather, and although for
months there was no general advance on either side, not
a day passed without new work for the surgeons, the
stretcher-bearers, and the grave-diggers. One incident is
typical of a hospital scene near the front. It was told in
a letter from a hospital nurse to a friend in Paris.</p>

<p>"About midday we received a wounded general, whom
we made as comfortable as possible in a little room.
Although he suffered terribly, he would submit to no
special care, and only thought of the comfort of two of
his officers. By an extraordinary chance a soldier of his
own regiment was brought in a few moments later. Joy
of the general, who wanted to learn at once what had
happened to his children. He asked to see the soldier
immediately:</p>

<p>"'Tell me&mdash;the commandant?'</p>

<p>"'Dead, mon général.'</p>

<p>"'And the captain?'</p>

<p>"'Dead, mon général.'</p>

<p>"Four times questions were asked, and four times the
soldier, whose voice became lower, made his answer of
death. Then the general lowered his head and asked no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
more. We saw the tears running down his scarred old
face, and we crept out of the room on tiptoe."</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE GHASTLY SCENES IN
FRANCE</p>

<p>In spite of all this tragedy, the French soldier into
whose soul it sank, and who will never forget, wrote
home with a gaiety which gleamed through the sadness
of his memories. There was a new series of "Lettres de
mon moulin" from a young officer of artillery keeping
guard in an old mill-house in an important position at the
front. They were addressed to his "dearest mamma,"
and, thoughtful of all the pretty hands which had been
knitting garments for him, he described his endeavours
to keep warm in them:</p>

<p>"To-night I have piled on to my respectable body a
flannel waistcoat, a flannel shirt, and a flannel belt going
round three times, a jacket with sleeves sent by
mamma herself, a leather waistcoat from Aunt Charlotte,
a woolen vest which came to me from the unknown
mother of a young dragoon, a warm undercoat recently
received from my tailor, and a woolen jacket and wrap
knitted by Madame P. J. So I prepare to sleep in peace,
if the 'Boches' will kindly allow me."</p>

<p>The enemy did not often allow the young gentleman
to sleep and about the windmill the shells were bursting.</p>

<p>They reached one Sunday morning almost as far as
the little twelfth-century church to which the young
officer had stepped down from his windmill to hear Mass
in the middle of a crowd of soldiers chanting the office,
recited by a soldier, accompanied by a harmonium played
by another soldier. The windows were shattered, and a
beautiful old house next to the church lay in ruins.</p>

<p>The officer spent lonely hours in the windmill in charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the telephone exchange, from which the batteries were
worked. The men in the trenches and the gun-pits pitied
his loneliness, and invented a scheme to cheer him up.
So after dark, when the cannonade slackened, he put the
receiver to his ears and listened to a Tyrolese ballad
sung by an orderly, and to the admirable imitation of a
barking dog performed by a sapper, and to a Parisian
<i>chanson</i> delightfully rendered by the aviator.</p>

<p>"Bonne nuit, maman," wrote the officer of artillery at
the end of each letter from his windmill....</p>

<p>There was a little farm near Steinbach round which a
battle raged for many days. Leading to it was a sunken
road, defended by the enemy, until one day they put
up a number of non-combatants from captured villages
to prevent a French attack.</p>

<p>"Among them we could distinguish a woman, with her
hair falling to her shoulders and her hands tied behind
her back. This new infamy inflamed the courage of our
soldiers. A company rushed forward with fixed bayonets.
The road to the farm was swept by the enemy's
fire, but nothing stopped our men. In spite of our losses
we carried the position and are masters of the farm.
There was no mercy in those moments of triumph. The
ghastly business of war was done to the uttermost."</p>

<p>There were ghastly things in some of the enemy's
trenches. One of the worst of them was seen in the
forest of Apremont, in the district of Woevre, where the
enemy was strongly intrenched in some quarries quite
close to the French trenches, which sapped their way
forward to those pits. When the guns ceased firing the
French soldiers often heard the sound of singing. But
above the voices of the Germans there came sometimes a
series of piercing cries like the screeching of an owl in a
terrible plaint, followed by strange and blood-curdling
laughter. It was the voice of a mad woman who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
one of those captured from neighbouring villages and
brought into the trenches by the Germans. One day the
German soldiers carried her the length of their own
trenches. Only her head was visible above the ground.
She wore a German helmet above the wild hair which
blew in wisps about her death-white face, and it seemed
like a vision of hell as she passed shrieking with the
laughter of insanity.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF THE PRIEST-SOLDIERS</p>

<p>One turns from such horrors to the heroism of the
French soldier, his devotion to his officers, his letters to
that <i>chère maman</i> before whom his heart is always that
of a little child, to the faith which saves men from at
least the grosser brutalities of war....</p>

<p>The priest-soldier in France has been a spiritual influence
among his comrades, so that some of them fought
with nobler motives than that of blood-lust, and went to
death or victory, influenced not by hatred of fellow men,
but by a conviction that out of all that death there would
come a new life to nations, and that in killing their
enemy they were killing a brutal tyranny with its grip
upon the world, and a barbarism which would make
human life a slavery....</p>

<p>Not a week passed without some priest being cited in
the Order of the Day....</p>

<p>The Abbé Bertrand, vicar of St. Germain de Coulamer,
was mobilized on the outbreak of war, and for his
gallantry in the field promoted successively to the ranks
of sergeant, sergeant-major, sub-lieutenant, and lieutenant.
He fell on November 4 at the battle of
Audrechy, leading his men to the assault. A few days
before his death he wrote: "I always look upon this war
as an expiation, and I am proud to be a victim." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
again: "Oh, how cold the rain is, and how severe the
weather! For our faith in France I have offered God
to let me be wet and soaked to the very bones."</p>

<p>The story of the Abbé Armand, in the 14th battalion
of the Chasseurs Alpins, is that of a hero. A simple man,
he used to open his heart to his rough comrades, and
often in the trenches, under shell-fire, he would recite the
Psalms in a clear voice so that they could hear him. On
November 17, to the south of Ypres, his company was
selected to hold a dangerous position, swept by the heavy
guns of the Germans and near the enemy's trenches. All
day until the evening the priest and his comrades stayed
there, raked by a hideous shell-fire. At last nearly all
the men were killed, and on his side of the emplacement
the Abbé Armand was left with two men alive. He signaled
the fact to those below by raising three fingers, but
shortly afterwards a bullet struck him so that he fell
and another hit him in the stomach. It was impossible
to send help to him at the time, and he died half an hour
later on the tumulus surrounded by the dead bodies of
his comrades. They buried him up there, and that night
his loss was mourned, not without tears, by many rough
soldiers who had loved the man for his cheeriness, and
honoured him for the simple faith, which seemed to put
a glamour about the mudstained uniform of a soldier of
France.</p>

<p>There were scores of stories like that, and the army
lists contained the names of hundreds of these priest-soldiers
decorated with the Legion of Honour or mentioned
in despatches for gallant acts.</p>

<p>Not all French soldiers are like these priests who were
valiant with the spirit of Christian faith. Side by side
with the priest was the apache, or the slum-dweller, or
the peasant from the fields, who in conversation was
habitually and unconsciously foul. Not even the mild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
protest of one of these priests could check the flow of
richly imagined blasphemies which are learned in the
barracks during the three years' service, and in the <i>bistros</i>
of the back streets of France from Cherbourg to Marseilles.
But, as a rule, the priest did not protest, except
by the example of keeping his own tongue clean. "What
is the use?" said one of them. "That kind of thing is
second nature to the men and, after all, it is part of my
sacrifice."</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF GAIETY ON THE ROADS OF
FRANCE</p>

<p>Along the roads of France, swinging along to dig a
new line of trenches, or on a march from a divisional
headquarters to the front, the soldiers would begin one
of their Rabelaisian songs which have no ending, but in
verse after verse roam further into the purlieus of indecent
mirth, so that, as one French officer told me, "these
ballads used to make the heather blush." After the song
would come the great game of French soldiers on the
march. The humourist of the company would remark
upon the fatigued appearance of a <i>sous-officier</i> near
enough to hear.</p>

<p>"He is not in good form to-day, our little corporal.
Perhaps it has something to do with his week-end in
Paris!"</p>

<p>Another humourist would take up the cue.</p>

<p>"He has a great thirst, our corporal. His first bottle
of wine just whets his whistle. At the sixth bottle he
begins to think of drinking seriously!"</p>

<p>"He is a great amorist, too, they tell me, and very passionate
in his love-making!"</p>

<p>So the ball is started and goes rolling from one man to
another in the ranks, growing in audacity and wallowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
along filthy ways of thought, until the <i>sous-officier</i>, who
had been grinning under his <i>képi</i>, suddenly turns red
with anger and growls out a protest....</p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF THE EVENING OF LIQUID
FLAMES</p>

<p>The soldiers of France have learned the full range of
human suffering, so that one cannot grudge them their
hours of laughter, however coarse their mirth. There
were many armies of men from Ypres to St. Mihiel who
were put to greater tasks of courage than were demanded
of the human soul in medieval torture chambers, and
they passed through the ordeal with a heroism which belongs
to the splendid things of history. As yet the history
has been written only in brief bulletins stating facts
baldly, as when on a Saturday in March of 1915 it was
stated that "In Malancourt Wood, between the Argonne
and the Meuse, the enemy sprayed one of our trenches
with burning liquid so that it had to be abandoned. The
occupants were badly burned." That official account does
not convey in any way the horror which overwhelmed
the witnesses of the new German method of attacking
trenches by drenching them with inflammatory liquid.
A more detailed narrative of this first attack by liquid
fire was given by one of the soldiers:</p>

<p>"It was yesterday evening, just as night fell, that it
happened. The day had been fairly calm, with the usual
quantity of bursting shells overhead, and nothing forewarned
us of a German attack. Suddenly one of my
comrades shouted, 'Hallo! what is this coming down on
us? Any one would think it was petroleum.' At that
time we could not believe the truth, but the liquid which
began to spray on us was certainly some kind of petroleum.
The Germans were pumping it from hoses. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
sub-lieutenant made us put out our pipes. But it was a
useless precaution. A few seconds later incendiary
bombs began to rain down on us and the whole trench
burst into flame. It was like being in hell. Some of the
men began to scream terribly, tearing off their clothes,
trying to beat out the flames. Others were cursing and
choking in the hot vapour which stifled us. 'Oh, my
Christ!' cried a comrade of mine. 'They've blinded me!'
In order to complete their work those German bandits
took advantage of our disturbance by advancing on the
trench and throwing burning torches into it. None of
us escaped that torrent of fire. We had our eyebrows
and eyelashes burned off, and clothes were burned in
great patches and our flesh was sizzling like roasting
meat. But some of us shot through the greasy vapour
which made a cloud about us and some of those devils
had to pay for their game."</p>

<p>Although some of them had become harmless torches
and others lay charred to death, the trench was not abandoned
until the second line was ready to make a counter attack,
which they did with fixed bayonets, frenzied by
the shrieks which still came from the burning pit where
those comrades lay, and flinging themselves with the
ferocity of wild beasts upon the enemy, who fled after
leaving three hundred dead and wounded on the ground.</p>

<p>Along five hundred miles of front such scenes took
place week after week, month after month, from Artois
to the Argonne, not always with inflammatory liquid, but
with hand grenades, bombs, stink-shells, fire balls, smoke
balls, and a storm of shrapnel.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF THE HAND GRENADIERS</p>

<p>Out of the monotonous narratives of trench-warfare,
stories more horrible than the nightmare phantasies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Edgar Allan Poe, stories of men buried alive by sapping
and mining, and of men torn to bits by a subterranean
explosion which leaves one man alive amidst the litter of
his comrades' limbs so that he goes mad and laughs at
the frightful humour of death, come now and then to
reveal the meaning of this modern warfare which is hidden
by censors behind decent veils. It is a French lieutenant
who tells this story, which is heroic as well as
horrid:</p>

<p>"We were about to tidy up a captured trench. At the
barrier of sand bags which closed up one end of it, two
sentinels kept a sharp lookout so that we could work in
peace of mind. Suddenly from a tunnel, hidden by a
fold in the ground, an avalanche of bombs was hurled
over our heads, and before we could collect our wits ten
of our men had fallen dead and wounded, all hugger-mugger.
I opened my mouth to shout a word of command
when a pebble, knocked by a piece of shell, struck
me on the head, and I fell, quite dazed. But my unconsciousness
only lasted a second or two. A bursting shell
tore off my left hand and I was awakened by the pain
of it. When I opened my eyes and groaned, I saw the
Germans jump across the sand-bags and invade the
trench. There were twenty of them. They had no rifles,
but each man carried a sort of wicker basket filled with
bombs. I looked round to the left. All our men had
fled except those who were lying in their blood. And
the Germans were coming on. Another slip or two and
they would have been on the top of me. At that moment
one of my men, wounded in the forehead, wounded in the
chin, and with his face all in a pulp of blood, sat up,
snatched at a bag of hand grenades, and shouted out:</p>

<p>"'Arise, ye dead!'</p>

<p>"He got on his knees, and began to fling his bombs
into the crowd of Germans. At his call, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
wounded men struggled up. Two with broken legs
grasped their rifles and opened fire. The hero with his
left arm hanging limp, grabbed a bayonet. When I stood
up, with all my senses about me now, some of the Germans
were wounded and others were scrambling out of
the trench in a panic. But with his back to the sand-bags
stayed a German <i>Unteroffizier</i>, enormous, sweating,
apoplectic with rage, who fired two revolver shots
in our direction. The man who had first organized the
defense of the trench&mdash;the hero of that 'Arise, ye dead!'&mdash;received
a shot full in the throat and fell. But the man
who held the bayonet and who had dragged himself from
corpse to corpse, staggered up at four feet from the
sand-bags, missed death from two shots, and plunged his
weapon into the German's throat. The position was
saved, and it was as though the dead had really risen."</p>


<p>IX&mdash;STORY OF THE FRENCH DRAGOONS</p>

<p>A young Russian officer in the French dragoons told
me that he had been fighting since the beginning of the
war with never more than three hours' sleep a night and
often no sleep at all. On many nights those brief hours
of rest were in beetroot fields in which the German
shrapnel had been searching for victims, and he awakened
now and then to listen to the well-known sound of
that singing death before dozing off again.</p>

<p>It was "Boot and saddle" at four o'clock in the morning,
before the dawn. It was cold then&mdash;a cold which
made men tremble as with an ague. A cup of black
coffee was served, and a piece of bread.</p>

<p>The Russian officer of French dragoons, who has lived
in British colonies, saw a vision then&mdash;a false mirage&mdash;of
a British breakfast. It was the thought of grilled
bloaters, followed by ham and eggs, which unmanned him
for a moment. Ten minutes later the cavalry was moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
away. A detachment was sent forward on a mission
of peril, to guard a bridge. There was a bridge near
Béthune one night guarded by a little patrol. It was
only when the last man had been killed that the Germans
made their way across.</p>

<p>Through the darkness these mounted men leaned forward
over their saddles, peering for the enemy, listening
for any jangle of stirrup or clink of bit. On that night
there came a whisper from the cavalry leader.</p>

<p>"They are coming!... Quiet there!"</p>

<p>A file of dark shadows moved forward. The dragoons
swung their carbines forward. There was a volley of
shots before the cry rang out.</p>

<p>"Cessez feu! Cessez feu!"</p>

<p>The cry had been heard before from German officers
speaking excellent French, but this time there was no
treachery in it. The shadows who moved forward
through the night were Frenchmen changing from one
trench to another.</p>

<p>The risk of death is taken lightly by all these men. It
is curious, indeed, that almost every French soldier has
a conviction that he will die in battle sooner or later.
In moments of imagination he sees his own corpse lying
out in the field, and is full of pity for his wife and children.
But it does not destroy his courage or his gift of
gaiety or his desire to fight for France or his sublime
endurance of pain.</p>


<p>X&mdash;STORY OF THE SINGING ARMY AT AMIENS</p>

<p>It is curious how long the song of La Marseillaise has
held its power. It has been like a leit-motif through all
the drama of this war in France, through the spirit of the
French people waiting patiently for victory, hiding their
tears for the dead, consoling their wounded and their
cripples, and giving their youngest and their manhood to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the God of War. What is the magic in this tune so that
if one hear it even on a cheap piano in an auxiliary hospital,
or scraped thinly on a violin in a courtyard of Paris,
it thrills one horribly? On the night of August 2, when
I traveled from Paris to Nancy, it seemed to me that
France sang La Marseillaise&mdash;the strains of it rose from
every wayside station&mdash;and that out of its graveyards
across those dark hills and fields, with a thin luminous
line on the far horizon the ghosts of slain soldiers rose
to sing it to those men who were going to fight again
for liberty.</p>

<p>Since then it has always been in my ears. I heard it
that night in Amiens when the French army was in
retreat, and when all the young men of the city, not yet
called to the colours because of their youth, escaped hurriedly
on truck trains before a bridge was blown up, so
that if they stayed they would be prisoners in German
hands. It was these boys who sang it, with fresh, clear
voices, joining in a fine chorus, though not far away the
soldiers of France were limping through the night from
abandoned positions:</p>

<div class="poem">
<i>Entendez-vous, dans les campagnes,</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Mugir ces féroces soldats?</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Ils viennent jusque dans nos bras</i></span><br />
<i>Egorger nos fils, nos compagnes!</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Aux armes, citoyens!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Aux armes, citoyens!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Formez vos bataillons!</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Marchons!...</i></span><br />
</div>

<p>I listened to those boys' voices, and something of the
history of the song put its spell upon me then. There
was the passion of old heroism in it, of old and bloody
deeds....</p>

<p>Poor devils! Hundreds of them have told me their
stories and at the end of a tale of misery have said: "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
do not complain, you know. It's war, and I am glad to
do my duty for the sake of France." And yet sometimes,
when they thought back, to the homes they had
left, and their old ways of civil life, they had moments
of weakness in which all the strength of their souls
seemed to ebb away.</p>

<p>"It's fatal to think of one's life before the war," said
a young Frenchman who sat with me at the table of a
little café not far from the front. He was a rich young
man, with a great business in Paris which had been suspended
on the first day of mobilization, and with a pretty
young wife who had just had her first baby. Now he
was a simple soldier, and for nine months he had not
seen Paris or his home or his pretty wife. The baby's
eyes were gray-blue, it seemed, but he had not been able
to test the truth of that description.</p>

<p>"As a rule," he said, "one doesn't think back to one's
old life. A great gulf lies between us and the past and
it is as though one had been born again just to be a
soldier in this war. The roots of our former existence
have been torn up. All one's old interests have been
buried. My wife? I hardly ever think of her. My
home? Is there such a place?... It is only at night,
or suddenly, sometimes, as one goes marching with one's
company that one's thoughts begin to roam back over
old grounds for a moment or two. The other fellows
know what one's silence means, and one's deafness, so
that one doesn't hear a neighbour's joke or answer his
question. It gives one a horrible heartache and one is
overwhelmed with depression.... Great God, how long
is this war going to last?"</p>

<p>(This brilliant young English author continues to relate
the scenes his eyes have witnessed with the skill of
the master. His description of Paris during the siege is
a literary masterpiece.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

<h2>"TRENCHING AT GALLIPOLI"&mdash;IN
THE LAND OF THE TURKS</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Adventures of a Newfoundlander</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by John Gallishaw, Member of the First Newfoundland
Regiment</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is the personal narrative of a loyal Newfoundlander soldiering
in the disastrous Dardanelles campaign. This is an adventurous
story stranger than fiction; as well as a reliable
account by an unusually keen participant of the gigantic failure
at Gallipoli. Mr. Gallishaw was a student at Harvard when
the War began and he gives an extraordinarily vivid impression
of trench fighting and trench living. He tells how seven weeks
after the outbreak of the War, the Newfoundlanders joined the
flotilla containing the first contingent of Canadians. He was on
garrison duty for a time at Edinburgh Castle in Scotland and
then sent to Egypt. His book: "Trenching in Gallipoli" is published
by the <i>Century Company</i>, Copyright 1916, with whose

I&mdash;STORY OF A HARVARD STUDENT IN
TURKEY</p>

<p>The afternoon sun poured down steadily on little
groups of men preparing dugouts for habitation (at Gallipoli).
I had a good many details to attend to before I
could look about for a suitable place for a dugout. Men
had to be told off for different fatigues. Men for pick
and shovel work that night were placed in sections so
that each group would get as much sleep as possible.
All the available dugouts had been taken up by the first
comers....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<p>After much hunting, I found a likely looking
place. It was about seven feet square, and where
I planned to put the head of my dugout a large boulder
squatted. It was so eminently suitable that I wondered
that no one else had preëmpted it. I took off my equipment,
threw my coat on the ground, and began digging.
It was soft ground and gave easily.</p>

<p>A short distance away, I could see Art Pratt, digging.
He was finding it hard work to make any impression.
He saw me, stopped to mop his brow, and grinned
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"You should take soft ground like this, Art," I yelled.</p>

<p>"I've gone so far now," said Art, "that it's too late to
change," and we resumed our work.</p>

<p>After a few more minutes' digging, my pick struck
something that felt like the root of a tree, but I knew
there was no tree on that God-forsaken spot large enough
to send out big roots. I disentangled the pick and dug
a little more, only to find the same obstruction. I took
my small intrenching tool, scraped away the dirt I had
dug, and began cleaning away near the base of a big
boulder. There were no roots there, and gradually I
worked away from it. I took my pick again, and at the
first blow it stuck. Without trying to disengage it I
began straining at it. In a few seconds it began to give,
and I withdrew it. Clinging to it was a part of a Turkish
uniform, from which dangled and rattled the dried-up
bones of a skeleton. Nauseated, I hurriedly filled in the
place, and threw myself on the ground, physically sick.
While I was lying there one of our men came along,
searching for a place to bestow himself. He gazed inquiringly
at the ground I had just filled in.</p>

<p>"Is there anybody here?" he asked me, indicating the
place with a pick-ax.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, with feeling, "there is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"It looks to me," he said, "as if some one began digging
and then found a better place. If he don't come
back soon I'll take it."</p>

<p>For about fifteen minutes he stood there, and I lay
regarding him silently. At last he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go ahead," he said. "Possession is nine
points of the law, and the fellow hasn't been here to
claim it."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't if I were you," I said. "That fellow's
been there a hell of a long while."</p>

<p>I left him there digging, and crawled away to a safe
distance. In a few minutes he passed me.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" he demanded, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Because half of the company saw me digging there
and didn't tell me," I said.</p>

<p>I was prospecting around for another place when
Art Pratt hailed me. "Why don't you come with me,"
he said, "instead of digging another place?"</p>

<p>I went to where he was and looked at the dugout. It
wasn't very wide, and I said so. Together we began
widening and deepening the dugout, until it was big
enough for the two of us. It was grueling work, but by
supper time it was done. The night before, a fatigue
party had gone down to the beach and hauled up a big
field kitchen. Our cooks had made some tea, and we had
been issued some loaves of bread. Art unrolled a large
piece of cloth with all the pomp and ceremony of a man
unveiling a monument. He did it slowly and carefully.
There was a glitter in his eyes that one associates with
an artist exhibiting his masterpiece. He gave a triumphant
switch to the last fold and held toward me a large
piece of fresh juicy steak.</p>

<p>"Beefsteak!" I gasped. "Sacred beefsteak! Where
did you get it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Art leaned toward me mysteriously. "Officers' mess,"
he whispered.</p>

<p>"I've got salt and pepper," I said, "but how are you
going to cook it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Art, "but I'm going up to the
field kitchen; there's some condensed milk that I may be
able to get hold of to spread on our bread."</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE ROYAL ENGINEERS</p>

<p>While Art was gone, I strolled down the ravine a
little way to where some of the Royal Engineers were
quartered. The Royal Engineers are the men who are
looked on in training as a non-combatant force, with safe
jobs. In war-time they do no fighting, but their safe
jobs consist of such harmless work as fixing up barbed
wire in front of the parapet and setting mines under the
enemy's trenches. For a rest they are allowed to conduct
parties to listening posts and to give the lines for
advance saps. Sometimes they make loopholes in the
parapet, or bolster up some redoubt that is being shelled
to pieces.</p>

<p>The Turks were sending over their compliments just
as I came abreast of the Engineers' lines. One of the
engineers was sifting some gravel when the first shell
landed. He dropped the sieve, and turned a back somersault
into some gorse-bushes just behind him. The sieve
rolled down, swayed from side to side, and settled close
to my head, in the depression where I was conscientiously
emulating an ostrich. I gathered it to my bosom
tenderly and began crawling away. From behind a
boulder I heard the engineer bemoaning to an officer the
loss of his sieve, and he described in detail how a huge
shell had blown it out of his hands. Joyfully I returned
to Art with my prize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's that for?" said Art.</p>

<p>"Turn it upside down," I said, "and it's a steak
broiler."</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?" said Art.</p>

<p>I told him, and related how the engineer had explained
it to his officer.</p>

<p>Up at the field kitchen a group was standing around.</p>

<p>"What's the excitement?" I asked Art.</p>

<p>"Those fellows are a crowd of thieves," answered Art,
virtuously. "They're looking about to see what they can
steal. I was up there a few minutes ago and saw a can
of condensed milk lying on the shaft of the field kitchen.
They were watching me too closely to give me a chance,
but you might be able to get away with it."</p>

<p>The two of us strolled up slowly to where Hebe
Wheeler, the creative artist who did our cooking, was
holding forth to a critical audience.</p>

<p>"It's all very well to talk about giving you things to
eat, but I can't cook pancakes without baking powder.
You can't get blood out of a turnip. I'd give you the
stuff if I got it to cook, but I don't get it, do I, Corporal?"
said Hebe, appealing to me.</p>

<p>I moved over and stood with my back to the shaft on
which rested the tin of condensed milk.</p>

<p>"No, Hebe," I said, "you don't get the things; and
when you do get them, this crowd steals them on you."</p>

<p>"By God," said Hebe, "that's got to be put a stop to.
I'll report the next man I find stealing anything from
the cookhouse."</p>

<p>I put my hand cautiously behind my back, until I felt
my fingers close on the tin of milk. "You let me know,
Hebe," I said, as I slipped the tin into the roomy pocket
of my riding breeches, "and I'll make out a crime sheet
against the first man whose name you give." I stayed
about ten minutes longer talking to Hebe, and then returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to my dugout. Art had finished broiling the piece
of steak, and we began our supper. I put my hand in
my breeches' pocket to get the milk. Instead of grasping
the tin, my fingers closed on a sticky, gluey mass. The
tin had been opened when I took it and I had it in my
pocket upside down. About half of it had oozed over
my pocket. Art was just pouring the remainder on some
bread when some one lifted the rubber sheet and stuck
his head into our dugout. It was the enraged Hebe
Wheeler. As soon as he had missed his precious milk
he had made a thorough investigation of all the dugouts.
He looked at Art accusingly.</p>

<p>"Come in, Hebe," I said pleasantly. "We don't see you
very often."</p>

<p>Hebe paid no attention to my invitation, but glared
at Art.</p>

<p>"I've caught you with the goods on," he said. "Give
me back that milk, or I'll report you to the platoon
officer."</p>

<p>"You can report me to Lord Kitchener if you like,"
said Art, calmly, as he drained the can; "but this milk
stays right here."</p>

<p>Hebe disappeared, breathing vengeance.</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF A NIGHT IN THE DUG-OUTS</p>

<p>After supper that night a crowd sat around the dying
embers of the fires. This was one of the first positions
we had been in where there was cover sufficient to warrant
fires being lighted. A mail had been distributed
that day, and the men exchanged items of news and
swapped gossip. There were men there from all parts
of Newfoundland. They spoke in at least thirty different
accents....</p>

<p>Sometimes a friend of the absent "Half" would tell of
Half's exploit of stealing a trolley from the Reid Newfoundland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Company and going twenty miles to see a girl.
Sometimes the hero was a married man. Then it was
opined that his conjugal relations were not happy, and
the reason he enlisted was that "he had heard something."...
The lumbermen of Notre Dame Bay and
Green Bay told fearsome and wondrous tales of driving
and swamping, of teaming and landing, until one almost
heard the blows of ax, the "gee" and "haw" of the teamsters,
and smelt the pungent odor of new-cut pine. The
Reid Newfoundland Railway, the single narrow gauge
road that twists a picturesque trail across the Island, had
given largely of its personnel toward the making of the
regiment. Firemen and engineers, brakemen and conductors,
talked reminiscently of forced runs to catch expresses
with freight and accommodation trains. There is
an interesting tale of two drivers who blew their whistles
in the Morse code, and kept up communication with each
other, until a girl learned the code and broke up the
friendship. A steamship fireman contributed his quota
with a story of laboring through mountainous seas
against furious tides when the stokers' utmost efforts
served only to keep steamers from losing way. By comparison
with the homeland, Turkey suffered much; and
the things they said about Gallipoli were lamentable.
From the gloom on the other side of the fire a voice
chanted softly, "It's a long, long way to Tipperary, It's
a long way to go." Gradually all joined in. After Tipperary,
came many marching songs. "Are we downhearted?
NO," with every one booming out the "No."
"Boys in Khaki, Boys in Blue," and at last their own
song; to the tune of "There is a tavern in the town."</p>

<p>
And when those Newfoundlanders start to yell, start to yell.<br />
Oh, Kaiser Bill, you'll wish you were in hell, were in hell;<br />
For they'll hang you high to your Potsdam palace wall,<br />
You're a damn poor Kaiser, after all.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The singing died down slowly. The talk turned to the
trenches and the chances of victory, and by degrees to
personal impressions.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know," said one chap, "why we all enlisted."</p>

<p>"When I enlisted," said a man with an accent reminiscent
of the Placentia Bay, "I thought there'd be lots of
fun, but with weather like this, and nothing fit to eat,
there's not much poetry or romance in war any more."</p>

<p>"Right for you, my son," said another; "your King
and Country need you, but the trouble is to make your
King and Country feed you."</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you were in London now, Gal?" said
one chap, turning to me. "You'd have a nice bed to
sleep in, and could eat anywhere you liked."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "enough people tried to persuade me
to stop. One fellow told me that the more brains a man
had, the farther away he was from the firing-line. He'd
been to the front too. I think," I added, "that General
Sherman had the right idea."</p>

<p>"I wish you fellows would shut up and go to sleep,"
said a querulous voice from a nearby dugout.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're talking about, Gal; General
Sherman was an optimist."</p>

<p>"It doesn't do any good to talk about it now," said
Art Pratt, in a matter of fact voice. "Some of you enlisted
so full of love of country that there was patriotism
running down your chin, and some of you enlisted because
you were disappointed in love, but the most of you
enlisted for love of adventure, and you're getting it."</p>

<p>Again the querulous subterranean voice interrupted:
"Go to sleep, you fellows&mdash;there's none of you knows
what you're talking about. There's only one reason any
of us enlisted, and that's pure, low down, unmitigated
ignorance." Amid general laughter the class in applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
psychology broke up, and distributed themselves in their
various dugouts.</p>

<p>Halfway down to my dugout, I was arrested by the
sound of scuffling, much blowing and puffing, and finally
the satisfied grunt that I knew proceeded from Hebe
Wheeler.</p>

<p>"I've got a spy," he yelled. "Here's a bloody Turk."</p>

<p>"Turk nothing," said a disgusted voice. "Don't you
know a man from your own company?"</p>

<p>Hebe relinquished his hold on his captive and subsided,
grumbling. The other arose, shook himself, and
went his way, voicing his opinion of people who built
their dugouts flush with the ground.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the news from the Western
front?" said Art, when I located him.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The enemy are on the run at the Western front. The
British have taken four lines of German trenches for a
distance of over five miles in the vicinity of Loos. The
bulletin board at Brigade headquarters says that they
have captured several large guns, a number of machine
guns, and seventeen thousand unwounded prisoners. If
they can keep this up long enough for the Turks to realize
that it is hopeless to expect any help from that quarter,
Abdul Pasha will soon give in."</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE BOMB-THROWING
AUSTRALIANS</p>

<p>We were talking about Abdul Pasha's surrendering
when we dropped off to sleep. We must have been
asleep about two hours when the insistent, crackling
sound of rapid fire, momentarily increasing in volume,
brought us to our feet. Away up on the right, where the
Australians were, the sky was a red glare from the flashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of many rifles. Against this, we could see the occasional
flare of different coloured rockets that gave the
warships their signals for shelling. Very soon one of
our officers appeared.</p>

<p>"Stand to arms for the Newfoundlanders," he said.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The Australians are advancing," he answered.
"We'll go up as reinforcements if we're needed. Tell
your men to put on their ammunition belts, and have
their rifles ready. They needn't put on their packs;
but keep them near them so that they can slip them on if
we get the order to move away."</p>

<p>I went about among the men of my section, passing
along the word. Everybody was tingling with excitement.
Nobody knew just what was about to happen; but
every one thought that whatever it was it would prove
interesting. For about half an hour the rapid fire kept
up, then by degrees died down.</p>

<p>"Did you see that last rocket?" said a man near me;
"that means they've done it. A red rocket means that
the navy is to fire, a green to continue firing, and a white
one means that we've won."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mr. Nunns walked toward us. "You
can put your equipments off, and turn in again," he said,
"nothing doing to-night."</p>

<p>"What is all the excitement?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's the Anzacs again," he said; "when they
heard of the advance at Loos, they went over across, and
surprised the Turks. They've taken two lines of
trenches. They did it without any orders&mdash;just wanted
to celebrate the good news."</p>

<p>I was awakened the next morning by the sound of a
whizz-bang flying over our dugout. Johnny Turk was
sending us his best respects. I shook Art, who was sleeping
heavily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get up, Art," I said. I might as well have spoken
to a stone wall. I tried again. Putting my mouth to his
ear, I shouted, "Stand to, Art. Stand to."</p>

<p>Art turned over, sleeping. "I'll stand three if you
like, but don't disturb me," he muttered, and relapsed into
coma.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, two or three more shells came along.
They were well over the ridge behind us, but were landing
almost in the midst of another line of dugouts. I
stood gazing at them for a little while., A man passed
me running badly. "Come on," he gasped, "and yell for
the stretcher." I followed him without further question.
"It's all right," he said, slowing up just before we came
to the line of dugouts that had just been shelled.
"They've got him all right." We continued toward a
group that was crowded about a stretcher. A man was
lying on it, with his head raised on a haversack. He
rolled his eyes slowly and surveyed the group. "What
the hell is the matter?" he said dazedly; then felt himself
over gingerly for wounds. Apparently he could find
none. "What hit me?" he asked, appealing to a grinning
Red Cross man.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the other, "except about a ton of
earth. It's a lucky thing some one saw you. That last
shell buried you alive."</p>

<p>The whistle of a coming shell dispersed the grinning
spectators. I went back to my dugout, and found Art
busily toasting some bread over the sieve that I had commandeered
the day before.</p>

<p>"What was the excitement?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Charlie Renouf," I said, "was buried alive."</p>

<p>"Heavens," said Art, "he's the postman; we can't
afford to lose him. That reminds me that I've got to
write some letters."</p>

<p>While we were writing, the orderly sergeant, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
dread of loafers, who appoints all details for fatigue
work, bore down upon our dugout. "Two men from
you, Corporal Gallishaw," he said, "for bomb throwers.
Give me their names as soon as you can. They're for
practice this afternoon."</p>

<p>"One here, right away," said Art, "and put Lew O'Dea
down for the other."</p>

<p>Lew O'Dea was a character. He was in the next dugout
to me. The first day on the Peninsula, his rifle had
stuck full of sand, and some one had stolen his tin canteen
for cooking food. He immediately formed himself
into an anti-poverty society of one thereafter, and went
around like a walking arsenal. I never saw him with
fewer than three rifles, usually he carried half a dozen.
He always kept two or three of them spotlessly clean;
so that no matter when rifle inspection came, he always
had at least one to show. He had been a little late in
getting his rifle clean once and was determined not to be
caught any more. His equipment always contained a
varied assortment of canteens, seven or eight gas masks,
and his dugout was luxurious with rubber sheets and
blankets. "I inherited them," he always answered, whenever
anybody questioned him about them. With ammunition
for his several rifles, when he started for the
trenches in full marching order, he carried a load that a
mule need by no means have been ashamed of.</p>

<p>"Do you want to go on bomb throwing detail this
afternoon?" I called to O'Dea across the top of the dugout.</p>

<p>"Sure," he answered; "does a duck want to swim?"</p>

<p>"Fine," I said; "report here at two o'clock."</p>

<p>At two o'clock, accompanied by an officer and a sergeant,
we went down the road a little way to where
some Australians were conducting a class in bomb throwing.
A brown-faced chap from Sydney showed me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
difference between bombs that you explode by lighting
a match, and bombs that are started by pulling out a plug,
and the dinky little three-second "cricket balls" that
explode by pressing a spring. I asked him about the
attack the night before. He told me that they had been
for some time waiting for a chance to make a local advance
and that would capture an important redoubt in
the Turkish line. Every night at exactly nine o'clock,
the Navy had thrown a searchlight on the part of the
line the Anzacs wanted to capture. For ten minutes they
kept up heavy firing. Then, after a ten minutes' interval
of darkness and suspended firing, they began a second
illumination and bombardment, commencing always at
twenty minutes past nine, and ending precisely at half
past. After a little while, the enemy, knowing just the
exact minute the bombardment was to begin, took the
first beam of the searchlight as a hint to clear out. But
the night before, a crowd of eager Australians had crept
softly along in the shadow made doubly dark by the
glare of the searchlight, the noise of their advance covered
by the sound of the bombardment. As soon as the
bombardment ceased and the searchlight's beam was succeeded
by darkness, they poured into the Turkish position.
They had taken the astonished Turks completely
by surprise.</p>

<p>"We didn't expect to make the attack for another
week," said the Australian; "but as soon as our boys
heard that we were winning in France, they thought
they'd better start something. There hasn't been any
excitement over our way now for a long time," he said.
"I'm about fed up on this waiting around the trenches."
He fingered one of the little cricket-ball bombs caressingly.
"Think of it," he said; "all you do is press that
little spring, and three seconds after you're a casualty."</p>

<p>"Pressing the little spring," said I, "is my idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
nothing to do, unless you're a particularly fast sprinter."</p>

<p>"By the Lord Harry, Newfoundland," said the Australian,
with a peculiar, excited glint in his eye, "that's
an inspiration."</p>

<p>"What's an inspiration?" I asked, in bewilderment.</p>

<p>The Australian stretched himself on the ground beside
me, resting his chin in his cupped hands. "When I
was in Sydney," he said slowly and thoughtfully, "I did
a hundred yards in ten seconds easily. Now if I can get
in a traverse that's only eight or nine yards long, and
press the spring of one of those little cricket balls, I
ought to be able to get out on the other side of the
traverse before it explodes."</p>

<p>Art and Lew O'Dea passed along just then and I
jumped up to go with them. "Don't forget to look for
me if you're over around the Fifteenth Australians," said
the Australian. "Ask for White George."</p>

<p>"I won't forget," I said, as I hurried away to join
the others.</p>

<p>We were about half way to our dugouts when we
passed a string of our men carrying about twenty mail
bags. It was the second instalment of a lot of mail that
had been landed the day before. We followed the sweating
carriers up the road to the quarter-master sergeant's
dugout, and waited around humbly while that autocrat
leisurely sorted out the mail, making remarks about each
letter and waiting after each remark for the applause he
felt it deserved. With maddening deliberation he scanned
each address. "Corporal W. P. Costello." "He's at the
base," some one answered. Corporal Costello's letter
was put aside. "Private George Butler." Private Butler,
on the edge of the crowd, pushed and elbowed his
way toward the quarter-master sergeant. "Here you
are; letter for Butler."</p>

<p>I received one letter, and was sitting on the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
my dugout reading it when one of our men passing along,
yelled to me. "Hey," he said, "you come from the
United States, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said; "what do you want to know that for?"</p>

<p>"I've got something here," he said, stopping, "that
comes from there too." He dived into his pocket, and
produced a medley of articles. From these he selected
a small paper-wrapped parcel.</p>

<p>"What's that?" I said.</p>

<p>"It's chewing gum," he answered; "real American
chewing gum like the girls chew in the subway in New
York." He unwrapped it, selected a piece, placed it in
his mouth, and began chewing it with elaborated enjoyment.
After a few minutes, he came nearer. "By
golly," he said, with an exaggerated nasal drawl, "it's
good gum, I'll soon begin to feel like a blooming Yank.
I'm talking like a Yank already. Don't you wish you
had some of this?"</p>

<p>"I'll make you a sporting offer," I answered. "I'll
fight you for the rest of what you've got."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," he answered nasally; "it's made me
feel exactly like a Yank; I'm too proud to fight."</p>

<p>(This Newfoundland soldier-boy here tells about his
experiences in "No Man's Land"; his fights with the
Turks; how he was wounded and sent his last message
"home"; how he finally recovered and returned to
America.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

<h2>SCENES "IN A FRENCH HOSPITAL"</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Stories of a Nurse</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>By M. Eydoux-Demians&mdash;Translated by Betty
Yeomans</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a wonderful revelation of the soul of France. It gives
"impressions of things actually seen and heard, revealing the
wonderful courage and emotion that exists to-day in a French
provincial hospital." These notes have been collected in a
volume dedicated: "To My Five Brothers Wounded in the
Service of France." These touching and inspiring stories of
the wounded and nurses in a French hospital and told with a
dramatic and literary power which make them little masterpieces.
They form a most realistic picture of the human side
of the Great War. The selections herein given are from the
hundreds of thrilling anecdotes in the book, by courtesy of the
publishers, <i>Duffield and Company</i>: Copyrighted 1915.</p></blockquote>

I&mdash;STORIES OF THE WOUNDED ON THEIR
BEDS</p>

<p>On October sixth, (1914) last, I received a message
from the directress of the Hospital of Saint Dominic,
reading as follows:</p>

<p>"A large number of wounded have just arrived. We
can't take care of any more ourselves, and the moment
has come to call for volunteers. I shall expect
your help."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>One hour later, as you can easily imagine, I was at
Saint Dominic. This specially privileged hospital is
under the gentle management of the Sisters of St.
Vincent de Paul. Several years ago some of its devoted
trustees made one effort after another on its
behalf in Paris, and, after overcoming many difficulties,
reëstablished the Sisters of Charity amongst us
once again. They had not a doubt even then that
they were working in the interests of France's soldiers,
those same soldiers whose faces light up now
with such a special joy when they lie on their painful
stretchers, and catch sight, near the large entrance
porch, of the good white cornettes of the Sisters waiting
for them.</p>

<p>With my heart beating fast I entered the room to
which I had been assigned. There they all were before
me, these lads that had undergone that terrible
and fierce adventuring into war. I remember how
they went away in our wonderful mobilisation trains,
those makeshift, flower-bedecked trains that sped all
of them to the same destination, the same region of
glory and bloodshed. One long war cry seemed to
rise up from them over all our land. Our young
soldiers who went away in them had acquired an entirely
new way of shouting "<i>Vive la France</i>." It was
no longer as if they were on parade, notwithstanding
all the flowers that people tossed to them: it was
already the cry of men who were to lead in war's assaults,
and make the supreme sacrifice of their lives. I
remember one little infantryman of twenty years,
standing erect with folded arms in the back of his
compartment, his eyes flashing, and all the muscles of
his pale face taut. He kept repeating threateningly,
"<i>Vive la France&mdash;vive la France</i>," without a look toward
any one; saying it just to himself and for his
country. And I felt that it was as if he said: "We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
shall get them: we must get them, no matter what it
costs. As for me, well, you see, to begin with, my
life doesn't count any more." This very fellow is the
one, perhaps, who has come back now and sleeps here
in this first cot, where a face both energetic and infantile
shows in the midst of the blood-stained linen.</p>

<p>Sister Gabrielle made a tour with me of all the
patients. The memory of certain of them particularly
is fixed in my mind. There is number 3, here, who
got a bullet wound in the region of the liver, and has
to lie absolutely still, lest an internal hemorrhage may
occur at any moment. A warrior of twenty-three he
is, with cheeks as rosy as a girl's, and clear blue eyes.
He fought like a lion, they say, but here nothing could
be gentler. His appreciation for the least thing that
is done for him is touching. Number 8, little eight, as
they call him, a volunteer, who seems about fifteen,
and who has to live week after week propped on his
right side, on a hard hospital bed, on account of an
abscess following his wound. Number 12, an infantryman,
who got a bullet in the left temple; it was extracted
from his right maxillary, and in passing cut his
tongue in two. "Everything has been put back," said the
Sister, "but he can't talk yet, and he'll have to learn to
talk all over again, like a little child. In taking care of
him you must come every once in a while and see if you
can guess what he wants." Number 17, a brave among
the braves, who, under the enemy's fire, crawled ten kilometres
on his hands and knees, dragging his twice-wounded
foot behind him, to deliver an order that he had
been charged with. His wounds cause him cruel suffering,
and yet he seems illuminated as with some strange
inward joy. Number 24, nicknamed the little sieve, because
of his fifteen wounds. Number 32, who suffers
like a real martyr. His leg was literally shattered by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
fragments of a shell. It was a question whether it could
be saved at all, but following the directions of the war
surgeon, we are keeping up the attempt. Antiseptic injections
are made twice a day as deep as the bone. Number
30, who has lost an eye and has two open fractures
in his right arm. When I said to him: "You have given
a good deal for France," he answered, "It's the least I
could do." And he added, laughing, "I was so clumsy
with my hands. This will teach me to be clever even
with my left one."...</p>

<p>One cannot repeat too often or too admiringly, "Our
wounded." Our wounded, that is to say, those men who
have come back from that hell, "whose horrors," they
say themselves, "are indescribable;" those who have
marched beneath "that terrible, moving curtain of iron,"
to which an officer compared the mass of balls and shells
in battle, a mass so compact that it obscured the very
daylight on the firing line. Our wounded! Those, in a
word, who have brought back in their very flesh the
frightful scars of the enemy's iron, those who have cemented
with their own blood the human wall that is now
our frontier. They have come back, not with their courage
drained, broken down, horror-stricken, stunned&mdash;not
at all. They forget themselves to talk smilingly of
the great hope in which we all share. They are touched,
deeply touched, by the few hours of fatigue we undergo
for them each day&mdash;for them who have given almost
their lives.</p>

<p>My tasks were laid out for me, and I began work at
once, thanked by the soldiers almost in advance for my
trouble.</p>

<p>"It's a bit too much to see you work like this for us."</p>

<p>"All the same, no one has ever been served like this."</p>

<p>They are not a bit difficult, but pleased with everything,
these men who suffer so much, who have such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
right to every care. Alas, there are too many of them
(this hospital alone has as many as a thousand) to permit
of all the little comforting things that we should like
to do for them without stint. The Sister who cooks is
sorely driven, and even the prescribed dishes that she
sends up for the sickest ones are often far from appetizing.
For instance, I have just taken Number 13, who
is consumed by a lingering fever (a bullet passed through
his lung), a milk soup that smelt badly burned, and in
which pieces of half-cooked rice floated round. I sighed
a little about it as I put the napkin on the bed. Did he
understand what worried me? In any case, he shows no
distaste, and a quarter of an hour later, when I pass by
him, he motions to me, and says gently, "It was delicious,
madame."</p>

<p>That's the way they all are&mdash;all of them.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF SISTER GABRIELLE&mdash;"ARCHANGEL"</p>

<p>I study with emotion the admirable vision of the human
soul which the Sister of Charity and the wounded
soldier set before me. It is a vision which has intervened
always, as with an element of the supernatural, in our
war-time pictures, and, behold, now we find it again, almost
miraculously, in the supreme struggle of 1914.</p>

<p>Sister Gabrielle, who has charge of my room, her
identity quite hidden as it is by her archangel's name, is
the daughter of a general, as I know. She has three
brothers that have served beneath the colours. The oldest,
a quite young captain, has just met his death on the
field of honour. I happen to have learned the circumstances:
how, covered with blood already flowing from
three different wounds, Captain X nevertheless struggled
on bravely at the head of his men, and after several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hours of conflict was struck by a bullet full in the breast.
He fell, crying: "Don't fall back! That's my last order!"</p>

<p>Sister Gabrielle was told only last week of the glorious
grief that had been thrust upon her, but no one around
her would have guessed her sorrow. Possibly her smile
for the patients that day was a little more compassionate
and tender than usual, when she thought of her
brother enduring his moment of supreme agony alone
down there in the forests of the Vosges....</p>

<p>She is thin and frail&mdash;mortally ill herself, they say;
she was quite ill one month ago. But if you speak to her
of her health she interrupts you a little impatiently:</p>

<p>"We have given ourselves, body and soul, according
to our vows. To last a little longer or a little less doesn't
matter. The main thing is to fulfill our tasks. Besides,"
she adds, indicating her patients, "they have given their
lives for France. It is quite right, if it must be so, that
our lives be sacrificed to save them."...</p>

<p>In the lot of wounded that were sent in yesterday, forty
came to Sister Gabrielle directly from the Aisne. They
arrived toward the close of the day, and I shall never
forget the spectacle of that room. One stretcher succeeded
another, all borne slowly by the litter-men and
set down near the hastily prepared beds. Here and
there you caught a cry of pain that could not be kept in,
though there were no complaints, no continued groanings.
Yet now, when you lean over those glorious and lamentable
blue bonnets, cut as they are by bullets and
stained with the mud of the trenches, when you take off
the caps that have grown stiff with the dampness of the
long rains, you perceive their suffering by the glittering
look in their fevered eyes, their poor, worn faces and
ravaged features, sunken and hollow with suffering.
Then, all at once, at the least word, the old gallantry that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
we know so well reasserts itself. For example, they ask
the most touching and childish favours of us. Thus if a
limb that hurts too much must be lifted, or a piece of
clothing that binds a wound eased up, they all ask:</p>

<p>"Not the orderly, not the orderly, please! the Sister
or the lady."</p>

<p>The first words that the newcomers exchange with
their cot neighbours are not about their own hardships;
they speak first, and before anything else, of France.</p>

<p>"How are things going down there?"</p>

<p>"All right. We'll get them."</p>

<p>Then the newcomers, worn out as they are, sink into
feverish sleep, struggling sometimes for days between
realities and the persistent nightmare of the visions that
pursue them. That night in the room that was always so
still, but that now seemed more feverish than usual, I
heard a sound of smothered sobs. It was Number 25, a
big, good-looking soldier, whom each day I had seen
having his wound dressed, a real torture, without a word,
and who was sobbing now with his head in his pillow,
ashamed of his tears, but powerless to keep them back.
I went to him and tried to question him, but the soldiers
don't readily speak to you of the sorrows that touch their
hearts the deepest and most nearly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, lady; don't bother yourself about me. I
don't need anything."</p>

<p>"Is your pain worse, maybe?"</p>

<p>"I'm in pain, yes, terribly, but it isn't that."</p>

<p>"What is it, then? Won't you tell me?"</p>

<p>He denied me still, then, all at once, under the pressure
of his grief, he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do feel like confiding in you. I'll tell you
what it is. The comrade who was waiting next to me till
his bed was ready brought me news of the death of my
best friend. He was in his regiment and was killed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
his side. Oh, madame, he was such a fine fellow, so devoted
and full of courage. We were brought up together.
He was more than my chum; he was my friend."</p>

<p>He cried and cried. He had borne everything without
giving way&mdash;the continual nearness of death, the so hard
life in the trenches, the incessant physical suffering; but
the death of his friend crushed him and brought him
down to earth. And while I murmured words that, alas,
were futile for any change they made in his sorrow, but
which did some good, just the same, I heard him sobbing
in his pillow:</p>

<p>"My friend was killed. My friend was killed."</p>

<p>His friend&mdash;when one knows what the word <i>comrade</i>
means to them, one divines all that word friend may
mean, too.</p>

<p>Sister Gabrielle, whose infallible instinct brings her
always to the cots where the sickest of her children are,
passed near Number 25 and stopped a moment. She did
not ask him anything. She just put her hand caressingly
on his brown head, so young and virile, and said in her
firm, sweet voice:</p>

<p>"All right, my boy, all right. Courage. Remember all
this is for France."</p>

<p>Then turning to me, she said:</p>

<p>"Before night-time wouldn't you like to play a game
of dominoes with this good boy? He'll represent the
French forces, and in the morning he must be able to
tell me that he has won."</p>

<p>In the midst of his tears the young soldier, his heart
swelling in his distress, smiled at finding himself thus
treated like a child. They have such need of it, the soldiers,
after having done so valiantly the work of men!</p>

<p>III&mdash;STORIES OF THE SOLDIERS FROM THE
AISNE</p>

<p>It is comforting to hear them talk about their superior
officers, as a soldier of the 149th Infantry has just talked
to me about his captain.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can tell you, my captain had plenty of good
blood in his veins. There was nothing suspicious about
him. I saw him standing straight up among the whistling
bullets, giving his orders without flinching, without
recoiling one inch, as if he were sitting at his desk and
only flies were buzzing round his head. And so gentle,
too. Good to the men and always jolly. We were in luck
to have him over us."</p>

<p>I asked him questions about his campaign, and he talked
freely, having only good things to tell. The taciturn ones
are those who have sad memories to conceal.</p>

<p>"We were the ones told off to take the village of
S&mdash;&mdash;," he said, "where the enemy was. My captain,
who acted as chief of battalion, got us all together, and
said to us:</p>

<p>"'There seem to be two or three Boches down there.
We must get them out, eh?'</p>

<p>"Everybody knew very well what that meant, but we
laughed and went to it in good part. What fights those
were! Two days of bloody battles in the streets. Finally
the village was ours. We had one night's rest in a farmhouse,
three-quarters of which had been destroyed.
When we got there we spied an unfortunate porker in a
corner. He had taken refuge there, frightened by the
firing. He came in very handy, I can tell you, for our
stomachs were hollow.</p>

<p>"'Charge again on that Boche, there,' said the Captain.
When he had eaten and slept and assembled again
next day, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well, my lads, we're in danger of getting too
soft here. Suppose we go on a little further and see
what's happening.'</p>

<p>"We marched on further, but the enemy, who were in
force, began to shoot at us all at once from below. My
Captain didn't expose us needlessly. He made us lie
down in the deserted trenches. There were corpses there
and dead horses, and water, water everywhere. It rained
without stopping. We spent the night up to our waists in
water. It was enough to make one laugh."</p>

<p>To laugh&mdash;this word turns up all the time in their recitals,
and in the most unexpected manner. Oh, this
French courage, which faces not only the bitter struggle
with danger, but disdains and mocks it, too; that elegant
courage of our fathers that has been born again amongst
us.</p>

<p>My foot-soldier, Number 149, was seized with quite
a touching emotion when I told him that I knew his Captain's
lady.</p>

<p>"Tell her she may be proud," he said, "and that I'd
willingly go back down there; for my country's sake, of
course, but also and a good deal, on my Captain's account."</p>

<p>Then I let him know something that I'd kept till the
end of our interview, that his Captain, young as he was,
had just been promoted to the rank of battalion chief;
that the Cross of the Legion of Honour had been given
him, and that, thanks to him, no doubt, the entire regiment
had been mentioned in the order of the day. I
won't attempt to picture the little soldier's moving and
disinterested joy.</p>

<p>Near Number 3's bed I caught sight of a peasant
woman from the Cher, in a white head-dress, and an old
man, who wore a medallion of 1870 on his breast.</p>

<p>"They are his parents," Sister Gabrielle explained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
me. "I had word sent to them. The poor lad is in grave
danger. Luckily I've got the management's permission
to let the mother pass the nights here."</p>

<p>In this way I became acquainted with the Mèchins,
French peasants of the old order, unalterably attached to
the soil. They hope, nay, they are sure, that their son is
going to get well. The sick man says nothing. They're
all like that, our soldiers&mdash;no foolish tenderness, no pain
given to their parents. Who knows, besides, how much
their desire to live may have dwindled down after their
tragic voyages to the frontier? The soul must possess
new powers of detachment when it has risen to the
heights of absolute self-sacrifice. The little soldier does
not deceive himself, Sister Gabrielle has told me, and
when I expressed my admiration for the strange moral
force that he gave proof of, she answered me proudly:</p>

<p>"But they are all like that."</p>

<p>Just as I was going to leave the room the sick man
summoned me with his eyes. I went up to him and bent
over him.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything?" I asked.</p>

<p>He made a sign of No, and with a great effort raised
his hand outside the bed and reached it toward me, murmuring:
"Thanks."</p>

<p>I understood. It was his good-bye. He thought that
he should perhaps not be there in the morning when I
came back.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORIES OF THE HOSPITAL ORDERLIES</p>

<p>The corps of orderlies is not always sympathetic. I
must say, however, that in the room where I am employed,
each one does his duty, thanks, no doubt, to the
active supervision of the Sister, thanks also perhaps to
three singularly moving personalities among the orderlies
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>To begin with, there is Nicolas Indjematoured, twenty-two,
a Greek, and a subject of the Ottoman empire. He
held a highly lucrative position, of which he was very
proud, in a bank at Constantinople, but when the war
broke out, he could not bear the thought of being drawn
into service with the Germans against France, and did
not hesitate to give up his job. He would not even see
his old mother again, but made a will providing for her
with all his small store of property, and sailed away as
a stowaway on a steamer which landed him at Marseilles.
He enlisted as a volunteer in the Legion and was ordered
here, where, however, soon after his arrival, he
received a serious finger wound, and was sent to St.
Dominic to be cured. He explained his state of mind to
me with simplicity and emotion:</p>

<p>"You can understand, madame, how ashamed I am,
among all these brave men, not to have done anything yet
for France. Luckily I can help Sister in serving them.
It's a great honour for me."</p>

<p>In the hospital room they all call him "the little Greek."
Night and day he holds himself in readiness to do things
for the invalids, whom he treats with touching consideration,
refusing doggedly to accept the least remuneration
from the management.</p>

<p>Boisset, a stubbly little orderly of some sixty years,
is an old employee of the hospital. An ex-pastry cook
with no family, he was operated on and cared for at the
hospital ten years ago. His case is one of those mysterious
stories of conversion that work themselves out in
secret near this cross-shaped chapel, with its four great
doors wide open on the wards of suffering.</p>

<p>Boisset, once cured, begged permission not to leave
the hospital, "hoping," as he said, "to consecrate my life
to God in the service of the poor wounded."</p>

<p>Do not his words recall those of the brothers of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Francis? Like them, Boisset has summed up his whole
life in these two words: simplicity and heroism. He is
at others' service night and day, just as he desired to be.
The Sister calls him "her right arm," something at which
he only half shows his pride. He is the one that's called
upon, with never any fear of putting him out, if there's
anything to be done in the way of lifting some fellow
on whom a specially delicate operation has been performed,
or doing some other difficult bit of duty. "Boisset,
Boisset!" You get accustomed to hearing his name
called out each moment. And Boisset, untiring, runs
from one bed to the other, with his mincing, weary step,
incessantly. In his moments of leisure he harks back to
his old trade, begging from the kitchen some left-over
bits of milk and whites of eggs, with which he cooks up
some sweet dishes for his beloved patients, by whom they
are much appreciated. What strikes me especially in
Boisset is his <i>joyful spirit</i>. This man, who deliberately
leads the hardest kind of life, has a smile always on his
lips, and cheerfulness always in his heart. In the little
recess where he does the patients' dishes you can hear
him humming the canticles, especially the magnificat, of
which he is very fond, as he confided to me, because it's
the song of joy. When I find myself with Boisset I always
want to talk to him about "Dame Poverty" and
"Charity, her hand-maiden."</p>

<p>Our third orderly, the Marquess of X, belongs to one
of the greatest Italian families. His mother was a
French woman, and from the very beginning of hostilities,
"he felt," as he put it, "the French blood boiling in
his veins."</p>

<p>He found a simple and admirable way of doing something
for his mother's country accordingly, by coming
and putting himself at the service of the wounded. He
wanted "to perform the humblest duties," he particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
specified. He did each day, from morning till night, very
humble and sometimes repulsive duties, without apparently
recoiling from them. He is but one in the nameless
crowd of orderlies, yet the patients very easily distinguish
him from the others, and the consolation and
care that he gives them are specially sweet to them, because
it includes the admiration of a noble soul and of
a whole race for the French soldier.</p>

<p>The day he arrived, the Marquess of X, after making
a tour of the wounded, came up to me with tears in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"What extraordinary reserves of energy and heroism
the French still have," he remarked to me, much moved.
"To hear these young fellows tell of the dangers they've
gone through, talking about sufferings, not only without
complaining of them, but laughing about them, is '<i>the
finest part of it all</i>.'"</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORIES FROM THE COTS OF THE
DYING</p>

<p>Sister Gabrielle accosted me this morning with a
luminous smile:</p>

<p>"We shall certainly save Number 32's leg. The work
of disinfection is finished. The flesh begins to form
again over the wound."</p>

<p>She is radiant. Such are her joys, the only ones she
asks of life. Nothing else exists, or ever will exist for
her, and yet her face is still young. Let us incline our
heads before such lives as hers! In a flash I understand
whence comes the deep-seated affinity of soul that rules
between Sister Gabrielle and our soldiers; she has given
as they have given, everything, even themselves. Only
in her case, it is for always and under all circumstances.
I ask her what she thinks of Number 3, who seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
me to be picking up a bit. She shakes her head sadly.</p>

<p>"His parents are full of illusions about him, but we
can only prolong things for him, with all our care."</p>

<p>Sad, oh, how sad! A little later Mother Mèchin comes
and talks to me in a low voice about her son.</p>

<p>"Such a good boy, madame! He never gave us one
hour of trouble. He fought so well, they say, and at
home he was as gentle as a girl. And he didn't drink or
waste his money. Just imagine, he has saved up a thousand
francs, in little pieces, since he was a child. We
didn't want him to cut into this money to go to the wars.
We preferred to go without things ourselves to fit him
out, and let him keep his little savings. He will be very
glad of it when he gets married." Married! Alas, poor
boy! A terrible spouse is waiting for him, one who will
not give him up. But already he has marched before
her with as much courage as now perhaps he guesses at
her coming near. He is very feeble, but he makes a sign
that he would like to speak to me. I bend over his bed,
and he whispers in my ear:</p>

<p>"I took communion this morning: I am very glad."</p>

<p>I had just brought him a medal of the Holy Virgin.
He smiled with pleasure, and I am moved to the bottom
of my soul, seeing him kiss the medal and then place it on
his heart.</p>

<p>All this time we are making the acquaintance of newer
patients, as they are always coming into this ward, which
is reserved for those that have undergone the most serious
operations. "One never has the consolation of seeing
them completely cured," Sister Gabrielle warned me
with a sigh. I stop a moment before a little Turco, who
took part in the battle of the Aisne. Both his legs are
broken. His face stiffens with pain, and now and then
a groan escapes him, though it is at once suppressed. He
scolds himself about it, and warns himself, or calls me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
witness, I am not sure which, when I hear him murmuring:</p>

<p>"Just look! When you think of the ones who stayed
down there, ought you ever to groan? We are happier
here. It isn't right."</p>

<p>Those who stayed down there! The imagination recoils
before the picture evoked by those simple words;
those who stay behind down there in the cold and the
night, under constant menace by the barbarian enemy,
who stay to suffer agonies alone, to die; to see their blood,
without the help even of a single bandage, flow from
their broken flesh and fall to the last drop upon the soil
of France. I remember the words of another wounded
soldier:</p>

<p>"After the battle, that day, you couldn't hear yourselves
talk any more in the trenches for the cries of the
wounded. It was like one great uninterrupted wail. You
could make out appeals, prayers, calls for help, women's
names. Then, little by little, silence came again, as a
good many of them died. What we heard sound longest
on the battlefield, from one end to the other, was the
word 'Mother!' It is always those who are dying who
call like that; we know that well now."</p>

<p>Alas! What do we not know now of the many-sided
anguish and horror of death! We must certainly begin,
like the little Turco, to qualify as lucky the fellows whom
destiny delivers up to the hospital. And yet how they
suffer, even these. To physical torture is added too often
the worst tortures of the spirit.</p>

<p>"In the two months I've been away, not one bit of
news of my family has reached me," a soldier told me,
"except a despatch announcing my father's death."</p>

<p>Another had lost a fifteen-year-old son, whom he
adored, two hours before his departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"His body was still warm: my wife was as if mad with
sorrow."</p>

<p>They tell you these things without complaint. France
called them: it was quite natural to answer her, to go to
her out of the midst of the greatest sorrows, the deepest
affections, the keenest happiness; sometimes, like that
young engineer there of twenty, married eleven months
ago to a girl of eighteen, to tear yourself away from a
whole romance! He had been rejected for defective
vision, but, and his wife agreed, he decided this did not
matter any more, now that mobilization was under way,
and that he must go. Two days after the birth of a fine
boy&mdash;a future soldier, the mother said&mdash;he left his life
of ease and tenderness and reported at the barracks as a
simple soldier; and he had been encouraged to do so by
that little Parisienne whom we should have thought absorbed
in nothing but society and dress.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF THE DEATH OF A MARTYR</p>

<p>The little soldier Mèchin had a serious hemorrhage in
the night; he was in the operating room when I arrived at
the hospital this morning. The Sister had sent his parents
to pray in the chapel, they explained to me. The
work of attending to the sick went on as usual; nothing
must be allowed to stop the movement of the wheels. Toward
ten o'clock I saw the litter coming back, borne
slowly and with infinite precautions. Sister Gabrielle
walked quite near it, and never stopped repeating:
"Gently, more gently still."</p>

<p>The little soldier's face was as pale as a corpse; his
eyes, which seemed to have sunk back in their orbits, were
closed. When he was lifted up to put him on the bed,
the shock, light as it was, brought on the supreme crisis.
His breath, slow and scarcely perceptible, quickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
strangely. His candid blue eyes opened, dilated, immense,
as if looking for some one.</p>

<p>"He wants his parents," the Sister said to me in a low
voice. "Go and find them quickly. It's the end."</p>

<p>In the quiet chapel that opened from the big wards, the
poor Mèchins wept and prayed. I called them. The
mother clasped her hands together, turning to me:</p>

<p>"The operation was successful, wasn't it, madame?"</p>

<p>Alas! I don't know, I fear not; but they must come
quickly. Their tears blind them, she can't see her steps;
she stumbles, and I have to give her my arm for support.</p>

<p>The moment she approaches her son she recognizes
the shadow of death on his dear face, and would have
given a cry of sorrow, but that Sister Gabrielle stops her,
putting a finger on her lips. Soldiers who die must be
surrounded by so great a peace.</p>

<p>"Here is your mother, here quite near to you," says the
calm voice of the Sister in the ear of the dying man. "She
embraces you. Your father is here, too. And here is
the crucified One, Our Lord, here on your lips."</p>

<p>The little soldier kisses the cross and smiles at his
mother; then his eyes, wide open, and as if drawn by
some invincible attraction, turn and fix themselves on
the open window opposite the bed, through which can be
seen the infinite depths of the sky. Nothing again, till his
last breath was drawn, could make his gaze turn elsewhere.
Where have I already beheld a scene like this?
I remember&mdash;it was in Greece, at Athens, last year. In
the room of the tombs, a simple and admirable funeral
monument represents death. A fine young man of twenty
is standing ready to depart. His parents, their faces torn
with sorrow, stretch out their arms to him, calling him,
but he, so calm in the purity of the white marble, his eyes
as if fascinated, looks fixedly, with all his thought, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the distance, one knows not where. As we passed this
masterpiece, the young Greek who was with me whispered
to me:</p>

<p>"Look at that boy there. He sees <i>something else</i>."</p>

<p>Our little soldier, too, seemed to see something else.
The chaplain gave him the last blessings. The mysterious
shore drew nearer moment by moment. A deep silence,
solemnly calm and very moving, fell suddenly on the
great room into which the terrible visitor was so soon to
penetrate; truly he must die well, surrounded thus by
his comrades, upheld until the end by a Sister of Charity.
The wings of her white cornette tremble above the young
face in its last agony. The Sister's voice, already a supernatural
one, is the last of this world's voices that Private
Mèchin is to hear. She says, and he repeats slowly, the
supreme invocation: "O God, receive me into Thy Paradise.
Jesus, have mercy on me. Holy Mother of God,
pray for us in the hour of our death."</p>

<p>It is over ... the last breath exhales gently. The
young soldier's gaze is fixed forever on the great light of
God. Sister Gabrielle gently closes his eyelids and places
the crucifix on the boy's heart. All is so calm, so evangelical,
that the parents themselves dare not weep. Ah,
how truly he spoke, the chaplain who wrote from the
front: "The soldiers of France die without pain, like
angels."</p>

<p>When the parents were led away for a while Sister
Gabrielle piously replaced the sheet on the dead face, and
said to me:</p>

<p>"This is the time for the patients' dinners. If you will,
we'll go and serve them, and then we'll come back and
lay out the body of this poor lad here."</p>

<p>I look at her wonderingly; she is very pale, and her eyes
are full of unshed tears. She busies herself with the
necessities of them all, with her usual clear-headedness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Have they already broken with everything of earth, these
Sisters, lifted themselves for good above the most pardonable
frailty?</p>

<p>(Thus the author, M. Eydoux-Demians, continues to
relate her experiences in the hospitals, telling of "The
Funeral," "The First Communion," "Our Priests," "The
Little Refugee," and a half hundred other little tragedies
that bring tears to the eyes, a pain to the heart, and a
sense of overwhelming joy that manhood and womanhood
can rise to such noble heights in these days of terrible
suffering.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

<h2>"FLYING FOR FRANCE"&mdash;HERO
TALES OF BATTLES IN
THE AIR</h2>

<p class="center"><i>With the American Escadrille at Verdun</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by James R. McConnell, Sergeant-Pilot in the
French Flying Corps</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The story of how Jim McConnell, the young North Carolinian,
went to France and gave his life to the cause of human liberty,
is a noble tribute to young Americanism. His heroic deeds at
the battle of Verdun when he fought with the American aviators
in a sea of clouds is a classic that would do credit to the
ancient Greeks. A comrade tells this story: "One day in January,
1915, I saw Jim McConnell in front of the Court House
at Carthage, North Carolina. 'Well,' he said, 'I am all fixed up
and I am leaving on Wednesday.' 'Where for?' I asked. 'I
have got a job to drive an ambulance in France,' was his answer.
And then he went on to tell me, first, that as he saw it the
greatest event of history was going on right at hand. 'These
sand hills,' he said, 'will be here forever but the war won't&mdash;and
so I am going.' So he went. He joined the American
Ambulance Service in the Vosges, was mentioned many times
in the Orders of the Day for conspicuous bravery in saving
wounded under fire, and received the much-coveted Croix de
Guerre." As a Sergeant-Pilot in the Lafayette Escadrille of
American Aviators, McConnell was killed in March, 1917, in an
encounter with two Boche-driven aeroplanes. It was his hope
that he might lead a United States Army Aero Corps on the
French front. He, indeed, had a part in great deeds and left
the best description yet published of the most terrific battle in
the war up to the time of his death. His book, titled "Flying
for France," is published by <i>Doubleday, Page and Company</i>,
Copyright 1916-17. Some of his experiences herein related are
presented with their full authority in this collection of stories.</p></blockquote>

I&mdash;STORY OF THE AMERICAN AIRMEN</p>

<p>Beneath the canvas of a huge hangar mechanicians
are at work on the motor of an airplane. Outside, on
the borders of an aviation field, others loiter awaiting
their aërial charge's return from the sky. Near the hangar
stands a hut-shaped tent. In front of it several short-winged
biplanes are lined up; inside it three or four young
men are lolling in wicker chairs.</p>

<p>They wear the uniform of French army aviators.
These uniforms, and the grim-looking machine guns
mounted on the upper planes of the little aircraft, are the
only warlike note in a pleasantly peaceful scene. The war
seems very remote. It is hard to believe that the greatest
of all battles&mdash;Verdun&mdash;rages only twenty-five miles
to the north, and that the field and hangars and mechanicians
and aviators and airplanes are all playing a part
therein.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is the distant hum of a motor. One
of the pilots emerges from the tent and gazes fixedly up
into the blue sky. He points, and one glimpses a black
speck against the blue, high overhead. The sound of the
motor ceases, and the speck grows larger. It moves
earthward in steep dives and circles, and as it swoops
closer, takes on the shape of an airplane. Now one can
make out the red, white, and blue circles under the wings
which mark a French war-plane, and the distinctive insignia
of the pilot on its sides.</p>

<p>"<i>Ton patron arrive!</i>" one mechanician cries to another.
"Your boss is coming!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>The machine dips sharply over the top of a hangar,
straightens out again near the earth at a dizzy speed a
few feet above it and, losing momentum in a surprisingly
short time, hits the ground with tail and wheels. It
bumps along a score of yards and then, its motor whirring
again, turns, rolls toward the hangar, and stops. A
human form, enveloped in a species of garment for all
the world like a diver's suit, and further adorned with
goggles and a leather hood, rises unsteadily in the cockpit,
clambers awkwardly overboard and slides down to
terra firma.</p>

<p>A group of soldiers, enjoying a brief holiday from the
trenches in a cantonment near the field, straggle forward
and gather timidly about the airplane, listening open-mouthed
for what its rider is about to say.</p>

<p>"Hell!" mumbles that gentleman, as he starts divesting
himself of his flying garb.</p>

<p>"What's wrong now?" inquires one of the tenants of
the tent.</p>

<p>"Everything, or else I've gone nutty," is the indignant
reply, delivered while disengaging a leg from its Teddy
Bear trousering. "Why, I emptied my whole roller on a
Boche this morning, point blank at not fifteen metres off.
His machine gun quit firing and his propeller wasn't turning
and yet the darn fool just hung up there as if he were
tied to a cloud. Say, I was so sure I had him it made
me sore&mdash;felt like running into him and yelling, 'Now,
you fall, you bum!'"</p>

<p>The eyes of the <i>poilus</i> register surprise. Not a word
of this dialogue, delivered in purest American, is intelligible
to them. Why is an aviator in a French uniform
speaking a foreign tongue, they mutually ask themselves.
Finally one of them, a little chap in a uniform long since
bleached of its horizon-blue color by the mud of the firing
line, whisperingly interrogates a mechanician as to
the identity of these strange air folk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"But they are the Americans, my old one," the latter
explains with noticeable condescension.</p>

<p>Marvelling afresh, the infantrymen demand further
details. They learn that they are witnessing the return
of the American Escadrille&mdash;composed of Americans who
have volunteered to fly for France for the duration of
the war&mdash;to their station near Bar-le-Duc, twenty-five
miles south of Verdun, from a flight over the battle front
of the Meuse. They have barely had time to digest this
knowledge when other dots appear in the sky, and one
by one turn into airplanes as they wheel downward. Finally
all six of the machines that have been aloft are back
on the ground and the American Escadrille has one more
sortie over the German lines to its credit.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE PERSONNEL OF THE
ESCADRILLE</p>

<p>Like all worth-while institutions, the American Escadrille,
of which I have the honour of being a member, was
of gradual growth. When the war began, it is doubtful
whether anybody anywhere envisaged the possibility of
an American entering the French aviation service. Yet,
by the fall of 1915, scarcely more than a year later, there
were six Americans serving as full-fledged pilots, and
now, in the summer of 1916, the list numbers fifteen or
more, with twice that number training for their pilot's
license in the military aviation schools.</p>

<p>The pioneer of them all was William Thaw, of Pittsburg,
who is to-day the only American holding a commission
in the French flying corps. Lieutenant Thaw,
a flyer of considerable reputation in America before the
war, had enlisted in the Foreign Legion in August, 1914.
With considerable difficulty he had himself transferred,
in the early part of 1915, into aviation, and the autumn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of that year found him piloting a Caudron biplane, and
doing excellent observation work. At the same time,
Sergeants Norman Prince, of Boston, and Elliot Cowdin,
of New York&mdash;who were the first to enter the aviation
service coming directly from the United States&mdash;were at
the front on Voisin planes with a cannon mounted in the
bow.</p>

<p>Sergeant Bert Hall, who signs from the Lone Star
State and had got himself shifted from the Foreign Legion
to aviation soon after Thaw, was flying a Nieuport
fighting machine, and, a little later, instructing less-advanced
students of the air in the Avord Training School.
His particular chum in the Foreign Legion, James Bach,
who also had become an aviator, had the distressing distinction
soon after he reached the front of becoming the
first American to fall into the hands of the enemy. Going
to the assistance of a companion who had broken down in
landing a spy in the German lines, Bach smashed his
machine against a tree. Both he and his French comrade
were captured, and Bach was twice court-martialed by the
Germans on suspicion of being an American <i>franc-tireur</i>&mdash;the
penalty for which is death! He was acquitted but
of course still languishes in a prison camp "somewhere in
Germany." The sixth of the original sextet was Adjutant
Didier Masson, who did exhibition flying in the
States until&mdash;Carranza having grown ambitious in Mexico&mdash;he
turned his talents to spotting <i>los Federales</i> for
General Obregon. When the real war broke out, Masson
answered the call of his French blood and was soon
flying and fighting for the land of his ancestors.</p>

<p>Of the other members of the escadrille Sergeant Givas
Lufbery, American citizen and soldier, but dweller in
the world at large, was among the earliest to wear the
French airman's wings. Exhibition work with a French
pilot in the Far East prepared him efficiently for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
task of patiently unloading explosives on to German
military centres from a slow-moving Voisin which was
his first mount. Upon the heels of Lufbery came two
more graduates of the Foreign Legion&mdash;Kiffin Rockwell,
of Asheville, N. C., who had been wounded at Carency;
Victor Chapman, of New York, who after recovering
from his wounds became an airplane bomb-dropper and
so caught the craving to become a pilot. At about this
time one Paul Pavelka, whose birthplace was Madison,
Conn., and who from the age of fifteen had sailed the
seven seas, managed to slip out of the Foreign Legion
into aviation and joined the other Americans at Pau.</p>

<p>There seems to be a fascination to aviation, particularly
when it is coupled with fighting. Perhaps it's because
the game is new, but more probably because as a
rule nobody knows anything about it. Whatever be the
reason, adventurous young Americans were attracted by
it in rapidly increasing numbers. Many of them, of
course, never got fascinated beyond the stage of talking
about joining. Among the chaps serving with the American
ambulance field sections a good many imaginations
were stirred, and a few actually did enlist, when, toward
the end of the summer of 1915, the Ministry of War,
finding that the original American pilots had made good,
grew more liberal in considering applications.</p>

<p>Chouteau Johnson, of New York; Lawrence Rumsey,
of Buffalo; Dudley Hill, of Peekskill, N. Y.; and Clyde
Balsley, of El Paso; one after another doffed the ambulance
driver's khaki for the horizon-blue of the French
flying corps. All of them had seen plenty of action, collecting
the wounded under fire, but they were all tired of
being non-combatant spectators. More or less the same
feeling actuated me, I suppose. I had come over from
Carthage, N. C., in January, 1915, and worked with an
American ambulance section in the Bois-le-Prêtre. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
along I had been convinced that the United States ought
to aid in the struggle against Germany. With that conviction,
it was plainly up to me to do more than drive an
ambulance. The more I saw the splendour of the fight the
French were fighting, the more I felt like an <i>embusqué</i>&mdash;what
the British call a "shirker." So I made up my
mind to go into aviation.</p>

<p>A special channel had been created for the reception
of applications from Americans, and my own was favourably
replied to within a few days. It took four days more
to pass through all the various departments, sign one's
name to a few hundred papers, and undergo the physical
examinations. Then I was sent to the aviation depot at
Dijon and fitted out with a uniform and personal equipment.
The next stop was the school at Pau, where I was
to be taught to fly. My elation at arriving there was second
only to my satisfaction at being a French soldier.
It was a vast improvement, I thought, to the American
Ambulance.</p>

<p>Talk about forming an all-American flying unit, or escadrille,
was rife while I was at Pau. What with the
pilots already breveted, and the élèves, or pupils in the
training-schools, there were quite enough of our compatriots
to man the dozen airplanes in one escadrille.
Every day somebody "had it absolutely straight" that we
were to become a unit at the front, and every other day
the report turned out to be untrue. But at last, in the
month of February, our dream came true. We learned
that a captain had actually been assigned to command an
American escadrille and that the Americans at the front
had been recalled and placed under his orders. Soon
afterward we élèves got another delightful thrill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE FLIERS IN TRAINING</p>

<p>Thaw, Prince, Cowdin, and the other veterans were
training on the Nieuport! That meant the American
Escadrille was to fly the Nieuport&mdash;the best type of
<i>avion de chasse</i>&mdash;and hence would be a fighting unit. It
is necessary to explain parenthetically here that French
military aviation, generally speaking, is divided into three
groups&mdash;the <i>avions de chasse</i> or airplanes of pursuit,
which are used to hunt down enemy aircraft or to fight
them off; <i>avions de bombardement</i>, big, unwieldy monsters
for use in bombarding raids; and <i>avions de rélage</i>,
cumbersome creatures designed to regulate artillery fire,
take photographs, and do scout duty. The Nieuport is
the smallest, fastest-rising, fastest-moving biplane in the
French service. It can travel 110 miles an hour, and is
a one-man apparatus with a machine gun mounted on its
roof and fired by the pilot with one hand while with the
other and his feet he operates his controls. The French
call their Nieuport pilots the "aces" of the air. No wonder
we were tickled to be included in that august brotherhood!</p>

<p>Before the American Escadrille became an established
fact, Thaw and Cowdin, who had mastered the Nieuport,
managed to be sent to the Verdun front. While there
Cowdin was credited with having brought down a German
machine and was proposed for the <i>Médaille Militaire</i>,
the highest decoration that can be awarded a non-commissioned
officer or private.</p>

<p>After completing his training, receiving his military
pilot's brevet, and being perfected on the type of plane
he is to use at the front, an aviator is ordered to the reserve
headquarters near Paris to await his call. Kiffin
Rockwell and Victor Chapman had been there for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
months, and I had just arrived, when on the 16th of
April orders came for the Americans to join their escadrille
at Luxeuil, in the Vosges.</p>

<p>The rush was breathless! Never were flying clothes
and fur coats drawn from the quarter-master, belongings
packed, and red tape in the various administrative bureaux
unfurled, with such headlong haste. In a few
hours we were aboard the train, panting, but happy. Our
party consisted of Sergeant Prince, and Rockwell, Chapman,
and myself, who were only corporals at that time.
We were joined at Luxeuil by Lieutenant Thaw and Sergeants
Hall and Cowdin.</p>

<p>For the veterans our arrival at the front was devoid
of excitement; for the three neophytes&mdash;Rockwell, Chapman,
and myself&mdash;it was the beginning of a new existence,
the entry into an unknown world. Of course Rockwell
and Chapman had seen plenty of warfare on the
ground, but warfare in the air was as novel to them as
to me. For us all it contained unlimited possibilities for
initiative and service to France, and for them it must
have meant, too, the restoration of personality lost during
those months in the trenches with the Foreign Legion.
Rockwell summed it up characteristically.</p>

<p>"Well, we're off for the races," he remarked....</p>

<p>On our arrival at Luxeuil we were met by Captain
Thénault, the French commander of the American Escadrille&mdash;officially
known as No. 124, by the way&mdash;and motored
to the aviation field in one of the staff cars assigned
to us. I enjoyed that ride. Lolling back against
the soft leather cushions, I recalled how in my apprenticeship
days at Pau I had had to walk six miles for my
laundry....</p>

<p>Rooms were assigned to us in a villa adjoining the
famous hot baths of Luxeuil, where Cæsar's cohorts were
wont to besport themselves. We messed with our officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Captain Thénault and Lieutenant de Laage de Mux,
at the best hotel in town. An automobile was always on
hand to carry us to the field. I began to wonder whether
I was a summer resorter instead of a soldier.</p>

<p>Among the pilots who had welcomed us with open
arms, we discovered the famous Captain Happe, commander
of the Luxeuil bombardment group. The
doughty bomb-dispenser, upon whose head the Germans
have set a price, was in his quarters. After we had been
introduced, he pointed to eight little boxes arranged on
a table.</p>

<p>"They contain <i>Croix de Guerre</i> for the families of the
men I lost on my last trip," he explained, and he added:
"It's a good thing you're here to go along with us for
protection. There are lots of Boches in this sector."</p>

<p>I thought of the luxury we were enjoying: our comfortable
beds, baths, and motor cars, and then I recalled
the ancient custom of giving a man selected for the sacrifice
a royal time of it before the appointed day....</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE FIRST SORTIE IN THE
CLOUDS</p>

<p>The memory of the first sortie we made as an escadrille
will always remain fresh in my mind because it was
also my first trip over the lines. We were to leave at
six in the morning. Captain Thénault pointed out on his
aërial map the route we were to follow. Never having
flown over this region before, I was afraid of losing myself.
Therefore, as it is easier to keep other airplanes in
sight when one is above them, I began climbing as rapidly
as possible, meaning to trail along in the wake of
my companions. Unless one has had practice in flying
in formation, however, it is hard to keep in contact.
The diminutive <i>avions de chasse</i> are the merest pinpoints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
against the great sweep of landscape below and
the limitless heavens above. The air was misty and
clouds were gathering. Ahead there seemed a barrier of
them. Although as I looked down the ground showed
plainly, in the distance everything was hazy. Forging up
above the mist, at 7,000 feet, I lost the others altogether.
Even when they are not closely joined, the clouds, seen
from immediately above, appear as a solid bank of white.
The spaces between are indistinguishable. It is like being
in an Arctic ice field.</p>

<p>To the south I made out the Alps. Their glittering
peaks projected up through the white sea about me like
majestic icebergs. Not a single plane was visible anywhere,
and I was growing very uncertain about my
position. My splendid isolation had become oppressive,
when, one by one, the others began bobbing up above the
cloud level, and I had company again.</p>

<p>We were over Belfort and headed for the trench lines.
The cloud banks dropped behind, and below us we saw
the smiling plain of Alsace stretching eastward to the
Rhine. It was distinctly pleasurable, flying over this
conquered land. Following the course of the canal that
runs to the Rhine, I sighted, from a height of 13,000
feet over Dannemarie, a series of brown, woodworm-like
tracings on the ground&mdash;the trenches!</p>

<p>My attention was drawn elsewhere almost immediately,
however. Two balls of black smoke had suddenly
appeared close to one of the machines ahead of me, and
with the same disconcerting abruptness similar balls began
to dot the sky above, below, and on all sides of us.
We were being shot at with shrapnel. It was interesting
to watch the flash of the bursting shells, and the attendant
smoke puffs&mdash;black, white, or yellow, depending on
the kind of shrapnel used. The roar of the motor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
drowned the noise of the explosions. Strangely enough,
my feelings about it were wholly impersonal.</p>

<p>We turned north after crossing the lines. Mulhouse
seemed just below us, and I noted with a keen sense of
satisfaction our invasion of real German territory. The
Rhine, too, looked delightfully accessible. As we continued
northward I distinguished the twin lakes of
Gérardmer sparkling in their emerald setting. Where
the lines crossed the Hartmannsweilerkopf there were
little spurts of brown smoke as shells burst in the
trenches. One could scarcely pick out the old city of
Thann from among the numerous neighbouring villages,
so tiny it seemed in the valley's mouth. I had never been
higher than 7,000 feet and was unaccustomed to reading
country from a great altitude. It was also bitterly
cold, and even in my fur-lined combination I was shivering.
I noticed, too, that I had to take long, deep breaths
in the rarefied atmosphere. Looking downward at a certain
angle, I saw what at first I took to be a round,
shimmering pool of water. It was simply the effect of
the sunlight on the congealing mist. We had been keeping
an eye out for German machines since leaving our
lines, but none had shown up. It wasn't surprising, for
we were too many.</p>

<p>Only four days later, however, Rockwell brought down
the escadrille's first plane in his initial aërial combat. He
was flying alone when, over Thann, he came upon a
German on reconnaissance. He dived and the German
turned toward his own lines, opening fire from a long
distance. Rockwell kept straight after him. Then, closing
to within thirty yards, he pressed on the release of
his machine gun, and saw the enemy gunner fall backward
and the pilot crumple up sideways in his seat. The
plane flopped downward and crashed to earth just behind
the German trenches. Swooping close to the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Rockwell saw its débris burning away brightly. He had
turned the trick with but four shots and only one German
bullet had struck his Nieuport. An observation post
telephoned the news before Rockwell's return, and he got
a great welcome. All Luxeuil smiled upon him&mdash;particularly
the girls. But he couldn't stay to enjoy his
popularity. The escadrille was ordered to the sector of
Verdun.</p>

<p>While in a way we were sorry to leave Luxeuil, we
naturally didn't regret the chance to take part in the
aërial activity of the world's greatest battle. The night
before our departure some German aircraft destroyed
four of our tractors and killed six men with bombs, but
even that caused little excitement compared with going
to Verdun. We would get square with the Boches over
Verdun, we thought&mdash;it is impossible to chase airplanes
at night, so the raiders made a safe getaway....</p>

<p>The fast-flowing stream of troops, and the distressing
number of ambulances brought realization of the near
presence of a gigantic battle.</p>

<p>Within a twenty-mile radius of the Verdun front
aviation camps abound. Our escadrille was listed on
the schedule with the other fighting units, each of which
has its specified flying hours, rotating so there is always
an <i>escadrille de chasse</i> over the lines. A field wireless
to enable us to keep track of the movements of enemy
planes became part of our equipment.</p>

<p>Lufbery joined us a few days after our arrival. He
was followed by Johnson and Balsley, who had been on
the air guard over Paris. Hill and Rumsey came next,
and after them Masson and Pavelka. Nieuports were
supplied them from the nearest depot, and as soon as
they had mounted their instruments and machine guns,
they were on the job with the rest of us. Fifteen Americans
are or have been members of the American Escadrille,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
but there have never been so many as that on
duty at any one time.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF THE BATTLES IN THE SKIES</p>

<p>Before we were fairly settled at Bar-le-Duc, Hall
brought down a German observation craft and Thaw a
Fokker. Fights occurred on almost every sortie. The
Germans seldom cross into our territory, unless on a
bombarding jaunt, and thus practically all the fighting
takes place on their side of the line. Thaw dropped his
Fokker in the morning, and on the afternoon of the same
day there was a big combat far behind the German
trenches. Thaw was wounded in the arm, and an explosive
bullet detonating on Rockwell's wind-shield tore
several gashes in his face. Despite the blood which was
blinding him Rockwell managed to reach an aviation field
and land. Thaw, whose wound bled profusely, landed
in a dazed condition just within our lines. He was too
weak to walk, and French soldiers carried him to a field
dressing-station, whence he was sent to Paris for further
treatment. Rockwell's wounds were less serious and he
insisted on flying again almost immediately.</p>

<p>A week or so later Chapman was wounded. Considering
the number of fights he had been in and the
courage with which he attacked it was a miracle he had
not been hit before. He always fought against odds and
far within the enemy's country. He flew more than any
of us, never missing an opportunity to go up, and never
coming down until his gasolene was giving out. His
machine was a sieve of patched-up bullet holes. His
nerve was almost superhuman and his devotion to the
cause for which he fought sublime. The day he was
wounded he attacked four machines. Swooping down
from behind, one of them, a Fokker, riddled Chapman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
plane. One bullet cut deep into his scalp, but Chapman,
a master pilot, escaped from the trap, and fired several
shots to show he was still safe. A stability control had
been severed by a bullet. Chapman held the broken rod
in one hand, managed his machine with the other, and
succeeded in landing on a nearby aviation field. His
wound was dressed, his machine repaired, and he immediately
took the air in pursuit of some more enemies.
He would take no rest, and with bandaged head continued
to fly and fight.</p>

<p>The escadrille's next serious encounter with the foe
took place a few days later. Rockwell, Balsley, Prince,
and Captain Thénault were surrounded by a large number
of Germans, who, circling about them, commenced
firing at long range. Realizing their numerical inferiority,
the Americans and their commander sought the
safest way out by attacking the enemy machines nearest
the French lines. Rockwell, Prince, and the captain
broke through successfully, but Balsley found himself
hemmed in. He attacked the German nearest him, only
to receive an explosive bullet in his thigh. In trying to
get away by a vertical dive his machine went into a corkscrew
and swung over on its back. Extra cartridge rollers
dislodged from their case hit his arms. He was
tumbling straight toward the trenches, but by a supreme
effort he regained control, righted the plane, and landed
without disaster in a meadow just behind the firing line.</p>

<p>Soldiers carried him to the shelter of a nearby fort,
and later he was taken to a field hospital, where he lingered
for days between life and death. Ten fragments
of the explosive bullet were removed from his stomach.
He bore up bravely, and became the favourite of the
wounded officers in whose ward he lay. When we flew
over to see him they would say: <i>Il est un brave petit gars,
l'aviateur américain</i>. [He's a brave little fellow, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
American aviator.] On a shelf by his bed, done up in a
handkerchief, he kept the pieces of bullet taken out of
him, and under them some sheets of paper on which he
was trying to write to his mother, back in El Paso.</p>

<p>Balsley was awarded the <i>Médaille Militaire</i> and the
<i>Croix de Guerre</i>, but the honours scared him. He had
seen them decorate officers in the ward before they died.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF CHAPMAN'S LAST FIGHT</p>

<p>Then came Chapman's last fight. Before leaving, he
had put two bags of oranges in his machine to take to
Balsley, who liked to suck them to relieve his terrible
thirst, after the day's flying was over. There was an
aërial struggle against odds, far within the German lines,
and Chapman, to divert their fire from his comrades,
engaged several enemy airmen at once. He sent one
tumbling to earth, and had forced the others off when
two more swooped down upon him. Such a fight is a
matter of seconds, and one cannot clearly see what
passes. Lufbery and Prince, whom Chapman had defended
so gallantly, regained the French lines. They
told us of the combat, and we waited on the field for
Chapman's return. He was always the last in, so we
were not much worried. Then a pilot from another
fighting escadrille telephoned us, that he had seen a
Nieuport falling. A little later the observer of a reconnaissance
airplane called up and told us how he had witnessed
Chapman's fall. The wings of the plane had
buckled, and it had dropped like a stone he said.</p>

<p>We talked in lowered voices after that; we would read
the pain in one another's eyes. If only it could have
been some one else, was what we all thought, I suppose.
To lose Victor was not an irreparable loss to us merely,
but to France, and to the world as well. I kept thinking
of him lying over there, and of the oranges he was taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to Balsley. As I left the field I caught sight of
Victor's mechanician leaning against the end of our
hangar. He was looking northward into the sky where
his <i>patron</i> had vanished, and his face was very sad.</p>

<p>By this time Prince and Hall had been made adjutants,
and we corporals transformed into sergeants. I frankly
confess to a feeling of marked satisfaction at receiving
that grade in the world's finest army. I was a far more
important person, in my own estimation, than I had been
as a second lieutenant in the militia at home. The next
impressive event was the awarding of decorations. We
had assisted at that ceremony for Cowdin at Luxeuil,
but this time three of our messmates were to be honoured
for the Germans they had brought down. Rockwell
and Hall received the <i>Médaille Militaire</i> and the
<i>Croix de Guerre</i>, and Thaw, being a lieutenant, the
<i>Légion d'honneur</i> and another "palm" for the ribbon of
the <i>Croix de Guerre</i> he had won previously. Thaw,
who came up from Paris specially for the presentation,
still carried his arm in a sling.</p>

<p>There were also decorations for Chapman, but poor
Victor, who so often had been cited in the Orders of the
Day, was not on hand to receive them.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF THE MORNING SORTIE OVER
VERDUN</p>

<p>Our daily routine goes on with little change. Whenever
the weather permits&mdash;that is, when it isn't raining,
and the clouds aren't too low&mdash;we fly over the Verdun
battlefield at the hours dictated by General Headquarters.
As a rule the most successful sorties are those in the
early morning.</p>

<p>We are called while it's still dark. Sleepily I try to
reconcile the French orderly's muttered, <i>C'est l'heure,
monsieur</i>, that rouses me from slumber, with the strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
American words and music of "When That Midnight
Choo Choo Leaves for Alabam'" warbled by a particularly
wide-awake pilot in the next room. A few minutes
later, having swallowed some coffee, we motor to
the field. The east is turning gray as the hangar curtains
are drawn apart and our machines trundled out by the
mechanicians. All the pilots whose planes are in commission&mdash;save
those remaining behind on guard&mdash;prepare
to leave. We average from four to six on a sortie, unless
too many flights have been ordered for that day, in
which case only two or three go out at a time.</p>

<p>Now the east is pink, and overhead the sky has
changed from gray to pale blue. It is light enough to
fly. We don our fur-lined shoes and combinations, and
adjust the leather flying hoods and goggles. A good deal
of conversation occurs&mdash;perhaps because, once aloft,
there's nobody to talk to.</p>

<p>"Eh, you," one pilot cries jokingly to another, "I hope
some Boche just ruins you this morning, so I won't have
to pay you the fifty francs you won from me last night!"</p>

<p>This financial reference concerns a poker game.</p>

<p>"You do, do you?" replies the other as he swings into
his machine. "Well, I'd be glad to pass up the fifty to
see you landed by the Boches. You'd make a fine sight
walking down the street of some German town in those
wooden shoes and pyjama pants. Why don't you dress
yourself? Don't you know an aviator's supposed to look
<i>chic</i>?"</p>

<p>A sartorial eccentricity on the part of one of our colleagues
is here referred to.</p>

<p>The raillery is silenced by a deafening roar as the
motors are tested. Quiet is briefly restored, only to be
broken by a series of rapid explosions incidental to the
trying out of machine guns. You loudly inquire at what
altitude we are to meet above the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred metres&mdash;go ahead!" comes an answering
yell.</p>

<p>"<i>Essence et gaz!</i> [Oil and gas!]" you call to your
mechanician, adjusting your gasolene and air throttles
while he grips the propeller.</p>

<p>"<i>Contact!</i>" he shrieks, and "<i>Contact!</i>" you reply. You
snap on the switch, he spins the propeller, and the motor
takes. Drawing forward out of line, you put on full
power, race across the grass and take the air. The
ground drops as the hood slants up before you and you
seem to be going more and more slowly as you rise. At
a great height you hardly realize you are moving. You
glance at the clock to note the time of your departure,
and at the oil gauge to see its throb. The altimeter
registers 650 feet. You turn and look back at the field
below and see others leaving.</p>

<p>In three minutes you are at about 4,000 feet. You
have been making wide circles over the field and watching
the other machines. At 4,500 feet you throttle down
and wait on that level for your companions to catch up.
Soon the escadrille is bunched and off for the lines.
You begin climbing again, gulping to clear your ears in
the changing pressure. Surveying the other machines,
you recognize the pilot of each by the marks on its side&mdash;or
by the way he flies. The distinguishing marks of the
Nieuports are various and sometimes amusing. Bert
Hall, for instance, has <span class="smcap">Bert</span> painted on the left side of
his plane and the same word reversed (as if spelled backward
with the left hand) on the right&mdash;so an aviator
passing him on that side at great speed will be able to
read the name without difficulty, he says!</p>

<p>The country below has changed into a flat surface of
varicoloured figures. Woods are irregular blocks of dark
green, like daubs of ink spilled on a table; fields are
geometrical designs of different shades of green and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
brown, forming in composite an ultra-cubist painting;
roads are thin white lines, each with its distinctive windings
and crossings&mdash;from which you determine your
location. The higher you are the easier it is to read.</p>

<p>In about ten minutes you see the Meuse sparkling in
the morning light, and on either side the long line of
sausage-shaped observation balloons far below you.
Red-roofed Verdun springs into view just beyond.
There are spots in it where no red shows and you know
what has happened there. In the green pasture land
bordering the town, round flecks of brown indicate the
shell holes. You cross the Meuse.</p>

<p>Immediately east and north of Verdun there lies a
broad, brown band. From the Woevre plain it runs
westward to the "S" bend in the Meuse, and on the left
bank of that famous stream continues on into the Argonne
Forest. Peaceful fields and farms and villages
adorned that landscape a few months ago&mdash;when there
was no Battle of Verdun. Now there is only that sinister
brown belt, a strip of murdered Nature. It seems
to belong to another world. Every sign of humanity
has been swept away. The woods and roads have vanished
like chalk wiped from a blackboard; of the villages
nothing remains but gray smears where stone walls
have tumbled together. The great forts of Douaumont
and Vaux are outlined faintly, like the tracings of a finger
in wet sand. One cannot distinguish any one shell crater,
as one can on the pockmarked fields on either side. On
the brown band the indentations are so closely interlocked
that they blend into a confused mass of troubled
earth. Of the trenches only broken, half-obliterated links
are visible.</p>

<p>Columns of muddy smoke spurt up continually as high
explosives tear deeper into this ulcered area. During
heavy bombardment and attacks I have seen shells falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
like rain. The countless towers of smoke remind
one of Gustave Doré's picture of the fiery tombs of the
arch-heretics in Dante's "Hell." A smoky pall covers the
sector under fire, rising so high that at a height of 1,000
feet one is enveloped in its mist-like fumes. Now and
then monster projectiles, hurtling through the air close
by, leave one's plane rocking violently in their wake.
Airplanes have been cut in two by them.</p>

<p>For us the battle passes in silence, the noise of one's
motor deadening all other sounds. In the green patches
behind the brown belt myriads of tiny flashes tell where
the guns are hidden; and those flashes, and the smoke of
bursting shells, are all we see of the fighting. It is a
weird combination of stillness and havoc, the Verdun
conflict viewed from the sky.</p>

<p>Far below us, the observation and range-finding planes
circle over the trenches like gliding gulls. At a feeble
altitude they follow the attacking infantrymen and flash
back wireless reports of the engagement. Only through
them can communication be maintained when, under the
barrier fire, wires from the front lines are cut. Sometimes
it falls to our lot to guard these machines from
Germans eager to swoop down on their backs. Sailing
about high above a busy flock of them makes one feel
like an old mother hen protecting her chicks....</p>

<p>Getting started is the hardest part of an attack. Once
you have begun diving you're all right. The pilot just
ahead turns tail up like a trout dropping back to water,
and swoops down in irregular curves and circles. You
follow at an angle so steep your feet seem to be holding
you back in your seat. Now the black Maltese
crosses on the German's wings stand out clearly. You
think of him as some sort of big bug. Then you hear
the rapid tut-tut-tut of his machine gun. The man that
dived ahead of you becomes mixed up with the topmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
German. He is so close it looks as if he had hit the
enemy machine. You hear the staccato barking of his
mitrailleuse and see him pass from under the German's
tail.</p>

<p>The rattle of the gun that is aimed at you leaves you
undisturbed. Only when the bullets pierce the wings a
few feet off do you become uncomfortable. You see the
gunner crouched down behind his weapon, but you aim
at where the pilot ought to be&mdash;there are two men aboard
the German craft&mdash;and press on the release hard. Your
mitrailleuse hammers out a stream of bullets as you pass
over and dive, nose down, to get out of range. Then,
hopefully, you re-dress and look back at the foe. He
ought to be dropping earthward at several miles a minute.
As a matter of fact, however, he is sailing serenely
on. They have an annoying habit of doing that, these
Boches.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF A FIGHT OVER FORT
DOUAUMONT</p>

<p>Rockwell, who attacked so often that he has lost all
count, and who shoves his machine gun fairly in the
faces of the Germans, used to swear their planes were
armoured. Lieutenant de Laage, whose list of combats
is equally extensive, has brought down only one. Hall,
with three machines to his credit, has had more luck.
Lufbery, who evidently has evolved a secret formula,
has dropped four, according to official statistics, since his
arrival on the Verdun front. Four "palms"&mdash;the record
for the escadrille, glitter upon the ribbon of the <i>Croix de
Guerre</i> accompanying his <i>Médaile Militaire</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>A pilot seldom has the satisfaction of beholding the
result of his bull's-eye bullet. Rarely&mdash;so difficult it is
to follow the turnings and twistings of the dropping
plane&mdash;does he see his fallen foe strike the ground. Lufbery's
last direct hit was an exception, for he followed
all that took place from a balcony seat. I myself was
in the "nigger-heaven," so I know. We had set out on a
sortie together just before noon, one August day, and
for the first time on such an occasion had lost each other
over the lines. Seeing no Germans, I passed my time
hovering over the French observation machines. Lufbery
found one, however, and promptly brought it down.
Just then I chanced to make a southward turn, and
caught sight of an airplane falling out of the sky into
the German lines.</p>

<p>As it turned over, it showed its white belly for an
instant, then seemed to straighten out, and planed downward
in big zigzags. The pilot must have gripped his
controls even in death, for his craft did not tumble as
most do. It passed between my line of vision and a
wood, into which it disappeared. Just as I was going
down to find out where it landed, I saw it again skimming
across a field, and heading straight for the brown
band beneath me. It was outlined against the shell-racked
earth like a tiny insect, until just north-west of
Fort Douaumont it crashed down upon the battlefield.
A sheet of flame and smoke shot up from the tangled
wreckage. For a moment or two I watched it burn;
then I went back to the observation machines.</p>

<p>I thought Lufbery would show up and point to where
the German had fallen. He failed to appear, and I began
to be afraid it was he whom I had seen come down,
instead of an enemy. I spent a worried hour before my
return homeward. After getting back I learned that
Lufbery was quite safe, having hurried in after the fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to report the destruction of his adversary before somebody
else claimed him, which is only too frequently the
case. Observation posts, however, confirmed Lufbery's
story, and he was of course very much delighted. Nevertheless,
at luncheon, I heard him murmuring, half to
himself: "Those poor fellows."</p>

<p>The German machine gun operator, having probably
escaped death in the air, must have had a hideous descent.
Lufbery told us he had seen the whole thing,
spiralling down after the German. He said he thought
the German pilot must be a novice, judging from his
man&oelig;uvres. It occurred to me that he might have been
making his first flight over the lines, doubtless full of
enthusiasm about his career. Perhaps, dreaming of the
Iron Cross and his Gretchen, he took a chance&mdash;and then
swift death and a grave in the shell-strewn soil of Douaumont....</p>


<p>IX&mdash;STORY OF PRINCE'S AERIAL FIREWORKS</p>

<p>Now and then one of us will get ambitious to do something
on his own account. Not long ago Norman Prince
became obsessed with the idea of bringing down a German
"sausage," as observation balloons are called. He
had a special device mounted on his Nieuport for setting
fire to the aërial frankfurters. Thus equipped he resembled
an advance agent for Payne's fireworks more than
an <i>aviator de chasse</i>. Having carefully mapped the
enemy "sausages," he would sally forth in hot pursuit
whenever one was signalled at a respectable height. Poor
Norman had a terrible time of it! Sometimes the reported
"sausages" were not there when he arrived, and
sometimes there was a super-abundancy of German airplanes
on guard.</p>

<p>He stuck to it, however, and finally his appetite for
"sausage" was satisfied. He found one just where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
ought to be, swooped down upon it, and let off his fireworks
with all the gusto of an American boy on the
Fourth of July. When he looked again, the balloon had
vanished. Prince's performance isn't so easy as it
sounds, by the way. If, after the long dive necessary
to turn the trick successfully, his motor had failed to
retake, he would have fallen into the hands of the
Germans....</p>

<p>After dinner the same scene invariably repeats itself,
over the coffee in the "next room." At the big table
several sportive souls start a poker game, while at a
smaller one two sedate spirits wrap themselves in the
intricacies of chess. Captain Thénault labours away at
the messroom piano, or in lighter mood plays with Fram,
his police dog. A phonograph grinds out the ancient
query "Who Paid the Rent for Mrs. Rip Van Winkle?"
or some other ragtime ditty. It is barely nine, however,
when the movement in the direction of bed begins.</p>

<p>A few of us remain behind a little while, and the talk
becomes more personal and more sincere. Only on such
intimate occasions, I think, have I ever heard death
discussed. Certainly we are not indifferent to it. Not
many nights ago one of the pilots remarked in a tired
way:</p>

<p>"Know what I want? Just six months of freedom to
go where and do what I like. In that time I'd get everything
I wanted out of life, and be perfectly willing to
come back and be killed."</p>

<p>Then another, who was about to receive 2,000 francs
from the American committee that aids us, as a reward
for his many citations, chimed in.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't care much before," he confessed, "but
now with this money coming in I don't want to die until
I've had the fun of spending it."</p>

<p>So saying, he yawned and went up to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<p>X&mdash;STORY OF THE JOURNEY TOWARD THE
SOMME</p>

<p>On the 12th of October, twenty small airplanes flying
in a V formation, at such a height they resembled a
flock of geese, crossed the river Rhine, where it skirts
the plains of Alsace, and, turning north, headed for the
famous Mauser works at Oberndorf. Following in their
wake was an equal number of larger machines, and above
these darted and circled swift fighting planes. The first
group of aircraft was flown by British pilots, the second
by French and three of the fighting planes by Americans
in the French Aviation Division. It was a cosmopolitan
collection that effected that successful raid.</p>

<p>We American pilots, who are grouped into one escadrille,
had been fighting above the battlefield of Verdun
from the 20th of May until orders came the middle of
September for us to leave our airplanes, for a unit that
would replace us, and to report at Le Bourget, the great
Paris aviation centre.</p>

<p>The mechanics and the rest of the personnel left, as
usual, in the escadrille's trucks with the material. For
once the pilots did not take the aërial route but they
boarded the Paris express at Bar-le-Duc with all the enthusiasm
of schoolboys off for a vacation. They were to
have a week in the capital! Where they were to go after
that they did not know, but presumed it would be the
Somme. As a matter of fact the escadrille was to be sent
to Luxeuil in the Vosges to take part in the Mauser raid.</p>

<p>Besides Captain Thénault and Lieutenant de Laage
de Mieux, our French officers, the following American
pilots were in the escadrille at this time: Lieutenant
Thaw, who had returned to the front, even though his
wounded arm had not entirely healed; Adjutants Norman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Prince, Hall, Lufbery, and Masson; and Sergeants
Kiffin Rockwell, Hill, Pavelka, Johnson, and Rumsey.
I had been sent to a hospital at the end of August, because
of a lame back resulting from a smash up in landing,
and couldn't follow the escadrille until later.</p>

<p>Every aviation unit boasts several mascots. Dogs of
every description are to be seen around the camps, but
the Americans managed, during their stay in Paris, to
add to their menagerie by the acquisition of a lion cub
named "Whiskey." The little chap had been born on a
boat crossing from Africa and was advertised for sale
in France. Some of the American pilots chipped in and
bought him. He was a cute, bright-eyed baby lion who
tried to roar in a most threatening manner but who was
blissfully content the moment one gave him one's finger
to suck. "Whiskey" got a good view of Paris during
the few days he was there, for some one in the crowd
was always borrowing him to take him some place. He,
like most lions in captivity, became acquainted with bars,
but the sort "Whiskey" saw were not for purposes of
confinement.</p>

<p>The orders came directing the escadrille to Luxeuil
and bidding farewell to gay "Paree" the men boarded
the Belfort train with bag and baggage&mdash;and the lion.
Lions, it developed, were not allowed in passenger
coaches. The conductor was assured that "Whiskey"
was quite harmless and was going to overlook the rules
when the cub began to roar and tried to get at the railwayman's
finger. That settled it, so two of the men had
to stay behind in order to crate up "Whiskey" and take
him along the next day.</p>

<p>The escadrille was joined in Paris by Robert Rockwell,
of Cincinnati, who had finished his training as a
pilot, and was waiting at the Reserve (Robert Rockwell
had gone to France to work as a surgeon in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
American war hospitals. He disliked remaining in the
rear and eventually enlisted in aviation)....</p>


<p>XI&mdash;STORY OF THRILLING MOMENTS IN
THE AIR</p>

<p>Dennis Dowd, of Brooklyn, N. Y., is so far the only
American volunteer aviator killed while in training.
Dowd, who had joined the Foreign Legion, shortly after
the war broke out, was painfully wounded during the
offensive in Champagne. After his recovery he was
transferred, at his request, into aviation. At the Buc
school he stood at the head of the fifteen Americans who
were learning to be aviators, and was considered one of
the most promising pilots in the training camp. On
August 11, 1916, while making a flight preliminary to his
brevet, Dowd fell from a height of only 260 feet and was
instantly killed. Either he had fainted or a control had
broken.</p>

<p>While a patient at the hospital Dowd had been sent
packages by a young French girl of Neuilly. A correspondence
ensued, and when Dowd went to Paris on
convalescent leave he and the young lady became engaged.
He was killed just before the time set for the
wedding....</p>

<p>In a few days every one in this Anglo-American alliance
was calling each other by some nickname and swearing
lifelong friendship.</p>

<p>"We didn't know what you Yanks would be like," remarked
one of the Englishmen one day. "Thought you
might be snobby on account of being volunteers, but I
swear you're a bloody human lot." That, I will explain,
is a very fine compliment....</p>

<p>Considering the number of machines that were continually
roaring above the field at Luxeuil it is remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that only two fatal accidents occurred. One was
when a British pilot tried diving at a target, for machine-gun
practice, and was unable to re-dress his airplane.
Both he and his gunner were killed. In the second accident
I lost a good friend&mdash;a young Frenchman. He
took up his gunner in a two-seated Nieuport. A young
Canadian pilot accompanied by a French officer followed
in a Sopwith. When at about a thousand feet they began
to man&oelig;uvre about one another. In making a turn
too close the tips of their wings touched. The Nieuport
turned downward, its wings folded, and it fell like a
stone. The Sopwith fluttered a second or two, then its
wings buckled and it dropped in the wake of the Nieuport.
The two men in each of the planes were killed
outright.</p>

<p>Next to falling in flames a drop in a wrecked machine
is the worst death an aviator can meet. I know of no
sound more horrible than that made by an airplane crashing
to earth. Breathless one has watched the uncontrolled
apparatus tumble through the air. The agony felt
by the pilot and passenger seems to transmit itself to
you. You are helpless to avert the certain death. You
cannot even turn your eyes away at the moment of impact.
In the dull, grinding crash there is the sound of
breaking bones....</p>

<p>In spite of their bombardment of open towns and the
use of explosive bullets in their aërial machine guns, the
Boches have shown up in a better light in aviation than
in any other arm. A few of the Hun pilots have evinced
certain elements of honour and decency. I remember one
chap that was the right sort.</p>

<p>He was a young man but a pilot of long standing. An
old infantry captain stationed near his aviation field at
Etain, east of Verdun, prevailed upon this German pilot
to take him on a flight. There was a new machine to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
test out and he told the captain to climb aboard. Foolishly
he crossed the trench lines and, actuated by a desire
to give his passenger an interesting trip, proceeded
to fly over the French aviation headquarters. Unfortunately
for him he encountered three French fighting
planes which promptly opened fire. The German pilot
was wounded in the leg and the gasolene tank of his
airplane was pierced. Under him was an aviation field.
He decided to land. The machine was captured before
the Germans had time to burn it up. Explosive bullets
were discovered in the machine gun. A French officer
turned to the German captain and informed him that
he would probably be shot for using explosive bullets.
The captain did not understand.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot him," said the pilot, using excellent
French, "if you're going to shoot any one take me. The
captain has nothing to do with the bullets. He doesn't
even know how to work a machine gun. It's his first
trip in an airplane."</p>

<p>"Well, if you'll give us some good information, we
won't shoot you," said the French officer.</p>

<p>"Information," replied the German, "I can't give you
any. I come from Etain, and you know where that is as
well as I do."</p>

<p>"No, you must give us some worth-while information,
or I'm afraid you'll be shot," insisted the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"If I give you worth-while information," answered
the pilot, "you'll go over and kill a lot of soldiers, and if
I don't you'll only kill one&mdash;so go ahead."</p>

<p>The last time I heard of the Boche he was being well
taken care of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<p>XII&mdash;STORY OF ROCKWELL'S LAST FIGHT</p>

<p>Kiffin Rockwell and Lufbery were the first to get their
new machines ready and on the 23rd of September went
out for the first flight since the escadrille had arrived
at Luxeuil. They became separated in the air but each
flew on alone, which was a dangerous thing to do in the
Alsace sector....</p>

<p>Just before Kiffin Rockwell reached the lines he spied
a German machine under him flying at 11,000 feet. I
can imagine the satisfaction he felt in at last catching an
enemy plane in our lines. Rockwell had fought more
combats than the rest of us put together, and had shot
down many German machines that had fallen in their
lines, but this was the first time he had had an opportunity
of bringing down a Boche in our territory.</p>

<p>A captain, the commandant of an Alsatian village,
watched the aërial battle through his field glasses. He
said that Rockwell approached so close to the enemy that
he thought there would be a collision. The German
craft, which carried two machine guns, had opened a
rapid fire when Rockwell started his dive. He plunged
through the stream of lead and only when very close
to his enemy did he begin shooting. For a second it
looked as though the German was falling, so the captain
said, but then he saw the French machine turn rapidly
nose down, the wings of one side broke off and fluttered
in the wake of the airplane, which hurtled earthward in
a rapid drop. It crashed into the ground in a small field&mdash;a
field of flowers&mdash;a few hundred yards back of the
trenches. It was not more than two and a half miles
from the spot where Rockwell, in the month of May,
brought down his first enemy machine. The Germans
immediately opened up on the wreck with artillery fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
In spite of the bursting shrapnel, gunners from a nearby
battery rushed out and recovered poor Rockwell's broken
body. There was a hideous wound in his breast where
an explosive bullet had torn through. A surgeon who
examined the body, testified that if it had been an ordinary
bullet Rockwell would have had an even chance of
landing with only a bad wound. As it was he was killed
the instant the unlawful missile exploded.</p>

<p>Lufbery engaged a German craft but before he could
get to close range two Fokkers swooped down from
behind and filled his aeroplane full of holes. Exhausting
his ammunition he landed at Fontaine, an aviation
field near the lines. There he learned of Rockwell's
death and was told that two other French machines had
been brought down within the hour. He ordered his
gasolene tank filled, procured a full band of cartridges
and soared up into the air to avenge his comrade. He
sped up and down the lines, and made a wide détour to
Habsheim where the Germans have an aviation field, but
all to no avail. Not a Boche was in the air.</p>

<p>The news of Rockwell's death was telephoned to the
escadrille. The captain, lieutenant, and a couple of men
jumped in a staff car and hastened to where he had
fallen. On their return the American pilots were convened
in a room of the hotel and the news broken to
them. With tears in his eyes the captain said: "The
best and bravest of us all is no more."</p>

<p>No greater blow could have befallen the escadrille.
Kiffin was its soul. He was loved and looked up to by
not only every man in our flying corps but by every one
who knew him. Kiffin was imbued with the spirit of the
cause for which he fought and gave his heart and soul
to the performance of his duty. He said: "I pay my
part for Lafayette and Rochambeau," and he gave the
fullest measure. The old flame of chivalry burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
brightly in this boy's fine and sensitive being. With his
death France lost one of her most valuable pilots. When
he was over the lines the Germans did not pass&mdash;and he
was over them most of the time. He brought down four
enemy planes that were credited to him officially, and
Lieutenant de Laage, who was his fighting partner, says
he is convinced that Rockwell accounted for many others
which fell too far within the German lines to be observed.
Rockwell had been given the Médaille Militaire and the
Croix de Guerre, on the ribbon of which he wore four
palms, representing the four magnificent citations he had
received in the order of the army. As a further reward
for his excellent work he had been proposed for promotion
from the grade of sergeant to that of second lieutenant.
Unfortunately the official order did not arrive
until a few days following his death.</p>

<p>The night before Rockwell was killed he had stated
that if he were brought down he would like to be buried
where he fell. It was impossible, however, to place him
in a grave so near the trenches. His body was draped
in a French flag and brought back to Luxeuil. He was
given a funeral worthy of a general. His brother, Paul,
who had fought in the Legion with him, and who had
been rendered unfit for service by a wound, was granted
permission to attend the obsequies. Pilots from all nearby
camps flew over to render homage to Rockwell's remains.
Every Frenchman in the aviation at Luxeuil
marched behind the bier. The British pilots, followed
by a detachment of five hundred of their men, were in
line, and a battalion of French troops brought up the
rear. As the slow moving procession of blue and khaki-clad
men passed from the church to the graveyard, airplanes
circled at a feeble height above and showered
down myriads of flowers.</p>

<p>Rockwell's death urged the rest of the men to greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
action, and the few who had machines were constantly
after the Boches. Prince brought one down. Lufbery,
the most skillful and successful fighter in the escadrille,
would venture far into the enemy's lines and spiral down
over a German aviation camp, daring the pilots to venture
forth. One day he stirred them up, but as he was short
of fuel he had to make for home before they took to the
air. Prince was out in search of a combat at this time.
He got it. He ran into the crowd Lufbery had aroused.
Bullets cut into his machine and one exploding on the
front edge of a lower wing broke it. Another shattered
a supporting mast. It was a miracle that the machine
did not give way. As badly battered as it was Prince
succeeded in bringing it back from over Mulhouse, where
the fight occurred, to his field at Luxeuil.</p>


<p>XIII&mdash;STORY OF LUFBERY'S DARING FLIGHT</p>

<p>The same day that Prince was so nearly brought down
Lufbery missed death by a very small margin. He had
taken on more gasolene and made another sortie. When
over the lines again he encountered a German with whom
he had a fighting acquaintance. That is he and the
Boche, who was an excellent pilot, had tried to kill each
other on one or two occasions before. Each was too good
for the other. Lufbery man&oelig;uvred for position but, before
he could shoot, the Teuton would evade him by a
clever turn. They kept after one another, the Boche
retreating into his lines. When they were nearing Habsheim,
Lufbery glanced back and saw French shrapnel
bursting over the trenches. It meant a German plane
was over French territory and it was his duty to drive
it off. Swooping down near his adversary he waved
good-bye, the enemy pilot did likewise, and Lufbery
whirred off to chase the other representative of Kultur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
He caught up with him and dove to the attack, but he
was surprised by a German he had not seen. Before
he could escape three bullets entered his motor, two
passed through the fur-lined combination he wore, another
ripped open one of his woolen flying boots, his airplane
was riddled from wing tip to wing tip, and other
bullets cut the elevating plane. Had he not been an
exceptional aviator he never would have brought safely
to earth so badly damaged a machine. It was so thoroughly
shot up that it was junked as being beyond repairs.
Fortunately Lufbery was over French territory or
his forced descent would have resulted in his being made
prisoner.</p>

<p>I know of only one other airplane that was safely
landed after receiving as heavy punishment as did Lufbery's.
It was a two-place Nieuport piloted by a young
Frenchman named Fontaine with whom I trained. He
and his gunner attacked a German over the Bois le Pretre
who drove rapidly far into his lines. Fontaine followed
and in turn was attacked by three other Boches. He
dropped to escape, they plunged after him forcing him
lower. He looked and saw a German aviation field under
him. He was by this time only 2,000 feet above the
ground. Fontaine saw the mechanics rush out to grasp
him, thinking he would land. The attacking airplanes
had stopped shooting. Fontaine pulled on full power
and headed for the lines. The German planes dropped
down on him and again opened fire. They were on his
level, behind and on his sides. Bullets whistled by him
in streams. The rapid-fire gun on Fontaine's machine
had jammed and he was helpless. His gunner fell forward
on him, dead. The trenches were just ahead, but
as he was slanting downward to gain speed he had lost a
good deal of height, and was at only six hundred feet
when he crossed the lines, from which he received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
ground fire. The Germans gave up the chase and Fontaine
landed with his dead gunner. His wings were so
full of holes that they barely supported the machine in
the air.</p>


<p>XIV&mdash;STORY OF A SURPRISE ATTACK ON
THE BOCHES</p>

<p>The uncertain wait at Luxeuil finally came to an end
on the 12th of October. The afternoon of that day the
British did not say: "Come on Yanks, let's call off the
war and have tea," as was their wont, for the bombardment
of Oberndorf was on. The British and French
machines had been prepared. Just before climbing into
their airplanes the pilots were given their orders. The
English in their single-seated Sopwiths, which carried
four bombs each, were the first to leave. The big
French Breguets and Farmans then soared aloft with
their tons of explosive destined for the Mauser works.
The fighting machines, which were to convoy them as far
as the Rhine, rapidly gained their height and circled
above their charges. Four of the battle planes were from
the American escadrille. They were piloted respectively
by Lieutenant de Laage, Lufbery, Norman Prince, and
Masson.</p>

<p>The Germans were taken by surprise and as a result
few of their machines were in the air. The bombardment
fleet was attacked, however, and six of its planes
shot down, some of them falling in flames. Baron, the
famous French night bombarder, lost his life in one of
the Farmans. Two Germans were brought down by
machines they attacked and the four pilots from the
American escadrille accounted for one each. Lieutenant
de Laage shot down his Boche as it was attacking another
French machine and Masson did likewise. Explaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
it afterward he said: "All of a sudden I saw a
Boche come in between me and a Breguet, I was following.
I just began to shoot, and darned if he didn't
fall."</p>

<p>As the fuel capacity of a Nieuport allows but little
more than two hours in the air the <i>avions de chasse</i> were
forced to return to their own lines to take on more gasolene,
while the bombardment planes continued on into
Germany. The Sopwiths arrived first at Oberndorf.
Dropping low over the Mauser works they discharged
their bombs and headed homeward. All arrived, save
one, whose pilot lost his way and came to earth in Switzerland.
When the big machines got to Oberndorf they
saw only flames and smoke where once the rifle factory
stood. They unloaded their explosives on the burning
mass.</p>

<p>The Nieuports having refilled their tanks went up to
clear the air of Germans that might be hovering in wait
for the returning raiders. Prince found one and
promptly shot it down. Lufbery came upon three. He
drove for one, making it drop below the others, then
forcing a second to descend, attacked the one remaining
above. The combat was short and at the end of it the
German tumbled to earth. This made the fifth enemy
machine which was officially credited to Lufbery. When
a pilot has accounted for five Boches he is mentioned by
name in the official communication, and is spoken of as
an "Ace," which in French aërial slang means a super-pilot.
Papers are allowed to call an "ace" by name, print
his picture and give him a write-up. The successful aviator
becomes a national hero. When Lufbery worked
into this category the French papers made him a head
liner. The American "Ace," with his string of medals,
then came in for the ennuis of a matinee idol. The
choicest bit in the collection was a letter from Wallingford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Conn., his home town, thanking him for putting
it on the map.</p>


<p>XV&mdash;STORY OF THE LAST FIGHT OF
NORMAN PRINCE</p>

<p>Darkness was coming rapidly on but Prince and Lufbery
remained in the air to protect the bombardment
fleet. Just at nightfall Lufbery made for a small aviation
field near the lines, known as Corcieux. Slow-moving
machines, with great planing capacity, can be
landed in the dark, but to try and feel for the ground
in a Nieuport, which comes down at about a hundred
miles an hour, is to court disaster. Ten minutes after
Lufbery landed Prince decided to make for the field. He
spiraled down through the night air and skimmed rapidly
over the trees bordering the Corcieux field. In the
dark he did not see a high-tension electric cable that was
stretched just above the tree tops. The landing gear
of his airplane struck it. The machine snapped forward
and hit the ground on its nose. It turned over and over.
The belt holding Prince broke and he was thrown far
from the wrecked plane. Both of his legs were broken
and he naturally suffered internal injuries. In spite of
the terrific shock and his intense pain Prince did not lose
consciousness. He even kept his presence of mind and
gave orders to the men who had run to pick him up.
Hearing the hum of a motor, and realizing a machine
was in the air, Prince told them to light gasolene fires on
the field. "You don't want another fellow to come down
and break himself up the way I've done," he said.</p>

<p>Lufbery went with Prince to the hospital in Gérardmer.
As the ambulance rolled along Prince sang to keep
up his spirits. He spoke of getting well soon and returning
to service. It was like Norman. He was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
energetic about his flying. Even when he passed through
the harrowing experience of having a wing shattered, the
first thing he did on landing was to busy himself about
getting another fitted in place and the next morning he
was in the air again.</p>

<p>No one thought that Prince was mortally injured but
the next day he went into a coma. A blood clot had
formed on his brain. Captain Haff in command of the
aviation groups of Luxeuil, accompanied by our officers,
hastened to Gerardmer. Prince lying unconscious on his
bed, was named a second lieutenant and decorated with
the Legion of Honour. He already held the Médaille
Militaire and Croix de Guerre. Norman Prince died
on the 15th of October. He was brought back to Luxeuil
and given a funeral similar to Rockwell's. It was hard
to realize that poor old Norman had gone. He was the
founder of the American escadrille and every one in it
had come to rely on him. He never let his own spirits
drop, and was always on hand with encouragement for
the others. I do not think Prince minded going. He
wanted to do his part before being killed, and he had
more than done it. He had, day after day, freed the line
of Germans, making it impossible for them to do their
work, and three of them he had shot to earth.</p>

<p>Two days after Prince's death the escadrille received
orders to leave for the Somme. The night before the
departure the British gave the American pilots a farewell
banquet and toasted them as their "Guardian Angels."
They keenly appreciated the fact that four men from
the American escadrille had brought down four Germans,
and had cleared the way for their squadron returning
from Oberndorf. When the train pulled out the next
day the station platform was packed by khaki-clad pilots
waving good-bye to their friends the "Yanks."</p>

<p>The escadrille passed through Paris on its way to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Somme front. The few members who had machines
flew from Luxeuil to their new post. At Paris the pilots
were reënforced by three other American boys who had
completed their training. They were: Fred Prince, who
ten months before had come over from Boston to serve
in aviation with his brother Norman; Willis Haviland, of
Chicago, who left the American Ambulance for the life
of a birdman, and Bob Soubrian, of New York, who had
been transferred from the Foreign Legion to the flying
corps after being wounded in the Champagne offensive....</p>

<p>(Here Jim McConnell continues to relate his adventures
in the air, describing how France trains her air
pilots. His book also contains many interesting letters
from him. And, then, alas, he, too, fell from the clouds
on that fatal day in March, 1917, and went to a hero's
grave.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>)</p>

<h2>THE LOG OF THE "MOEWE"&mdash;TALES
OF THE HIGH SEAS</h2>

<p class="center"><i>The Adventures of a Modern Pirate</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Count Dohna-Schlodien, her Commander, and
Translated by Eugenie Martin</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Everybody has heard of the <i>Moewe</i>, the German auxiliary
cruiser which on two occasions at least stole through the British
blockade and roamed about the Atlantic, sinking ships and occasionally
sending a prize like the <i>Appam</i> into port. Count
Dohna-Schlodien, the captain of this latter-day privateer, is a
popular hero in Germany. These tales are translations of the
gist of his exploits, as told in the <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE GERMAN MINE-LAYERS</p>

<p>"To lay mines along the enemy-shores and then make
a cruiser-campaign." Such, briefly, were my orders
when I was appointed commander of S. M. S. <i>Moewe</i> at
the end of 1915.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine my pride and elation.</p>

<p>To lay mines and injure the enemy's sea-borne trade!
Neither of these duties was new to the German Navy.</p>

<p>The clamorous complaints in the daily newspapers,
voicing the indignation of England, France, and Italy
concerning the heavy losses sustained by their mercantile
navy and cruisers, as well as against our interference
with their over-sea connections, were sufficient testimony
to the activity of our U-boats in the North Sea, the
Irish Sea, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea.</p>

<p>It fell to my share, however, to take a German cruiser
successfully into the far world-sea, where, since the exploits
of the <i>Karlsruhe</i>, the <i>Dresden</i>, the <i>Emden</i>, the
<i>Ayesha</i>, and the auxiliary cruisers <i>Prince Eitel Friedrich</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and <i>Kronprinz</i> the German flag had not dared to show
itself owing to the overwhelming superiority of the
enemy.</p>

<p>We Germans were sick of hearing England boast that
her fleet had driven us from the highways of the ocean,
and that her navy safeguarded the routes between Europe
and the United States, Africa, and Australia.</p>

<p>When I got my orders, I realized fully that if my plans
were to succeed, we must not count on daring and good
luck alone, but that cunning must make up for what we
lacked in strength.</p>

<p>Shortly before Christmas we made a few brief trial-trips.
Then we busied ourselves with the final and not
least important of our preparations&mdash;an attempt to give
the <i>Moewe</i> the aspect of an inoffensive merchant vessel.</p>

<p>Beaming with pleasant anticipations, the crew set to
work, and to such good purpose did they labor that within
a few hours the <i>Moewe</i>, under her fresh coating of
paint, was&mdash;outwardly at least&mdash;transformed into an
ordinary merchantman. Not even the most suspicious
English man-of-war would ever imagine for a moment
what a dangerous cargo she carried. But all this labor
of love was wasted. A heavy storm and a deluge of rain
forced us to suspend our work, and the next morning
the <i>Moewe</i> was in a sorry plight. The fresh paint had
run in streaks, and made her look like a marine zebra.
Fortunately, the weather remained dry the night before
we were to start. The painting was done again, and the
work was accomplished, this time with notable success,
for as a result of the damp first layer of paint the final
coating did not look too aggressively new.</p>

<p>We raised anchor and steamed out of port in a fog.
Soon we exchanged farewell greetings with the German
outpost boats, and, shortly after, reached the zone where
at any moment we might run against an English destroyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
or submarine. Everyone on board was strung up to the
highest pitch. What would the next moment bring us?
I recalled the remark of a friend who, on hearing of
my appointment, asked: "After all, what do you expect
to do? The very first day you will be captured!" From
the moment we were in the open sea we were prepared
for battle, and anyone who had attacked us, small or
big, would soon have discovered that the <i>Moewe</i> was not
quite so peaceful and tame as she looked. Nevertheless,
I must admit that too premature an encounter would
have been fatal to our object.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the weather favored us; a thick
fog encompassed us, and that first night was as dark as
we could have wished.</p>

<p>I told the crew briefly what was expected from them,
and pleasure showed in the face of every man when
he heard we were out against England, for to wipe out
the hated English foe is the dearest wish of every German
sailorman.</p>

<p>At dawn, after successful evading all notice, we were
in sight of Norway's snow-capped mountains, and we
continued our route with a favorable wind.</p>

<p>The day was exceptionally fine, and the fact that the
first difficulties had been so easily overcome filled me
with confidence in the future. It depended now entirely
upon me to lead my faithful crew and our good ship
to the desired goal and injure the enemy wherever we
might find him.</p>

<p>The last day of the old year turned out to be the
hardest we had experienced hitherto. To get as close
as possible to the English shores was our aim, but an
angry west wind continually obstructed us and interrupted
our course. I soon got sick of waiting and preferred
to run the risk of fighting the wind. I had to reckon,
however, with a specially furious sea. Drenched to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
skin, I finally gave up the struggle, and allowed the ship
to drift for hours.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the wind abated, and it was once
more possible to take a southerly course.</p>

<p>At last, when the lead gave twenty-five fathoms, a
powerful coast-light suddenly shed its radiance upon us.
We now knew all we wanted to know, and we turned
back, with the intention of steering straight for this spot
on the following day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the new year had come in, minus the usual
bell-ringing and songs! At seven o'clock in the morning
I entered my cabin drenched and frozen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The New Year began well.</p>

<p>We lay so quietly under the mild, westerly wind that,
having still a couple of hours before beginning our mine-laying,
we set to work painting the sides of the vessel,
badly damaged by the weather.</p>

<p>Then, in broad daylight, we slowly steered for the
English coast.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF MINES OFF THE ENGLISH
COAST</p>

<p>Those were hours I shall not easily forget. Far and
wide, nothing was to be seen on the surface of the sea.
In spite of a brilliant sun and a remarkably clear horizon,
we remained unnoticed. Nearer and nearer we drew
to the coast. Evidently the English had no idea that
this first day of the New Year was the dawn of a great
holiday for us and that there was a <i>Moewe</i> which, instead
of waiting for March and April, was determined,
at this unusual season, to lay a few eggs along the English
coast!</p>

<p>Mine-laying is not an easy task; the entire crew must
take a hand in it. As a rule, the mines&mdash;egg-shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
black monsters, almost the size of a man&mdash;lie carefully
stowed away in long rows in the hold. When the moment
to use them arrives they are brought to the upper
deck and there again arranged in rows. Shortly before
they are laid they are provided with ignition fuses. This
detail is attended to by a specially-trained <i>personnel</i>, under
the supervision of torpedo officers. At the command
"Throw!" each mine in turn receives a violent push and
drops with a graceful dive into the water at a safe distance
from the ship.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon when we began
to dispose of the mines. To the accompaniment of hissing
steam, the rolling of the mines between the lower
and upper tracks continued without interruption. Above,
on the bridge, joy reigned supreme, for the weather was
splendid and we followed the coastline without anything
suspicious coming in sight. In my most sanguine dreams
I could never have imagined that we would thus remain
unchallenged and unmolested.</p>

<p>At four o'clock a brilliant light once more beamed on
us from the shore. We could now see our exact whereabouts,
but, anxious not to be overtaken by the dark,
we almost immediately turned back.</p>

<p>The glass now began to drop suddenly; the wind rose,
and it began to rain. Soon a perfect deluge was falling.
So much the better&mdash;the worse the weather the better
for us! We resumed our mine-throwing, after the necessary
preparations.</p>

<p>Everything went well, though the storm raged more
furiously than ever. At nine o'clock, still undetected, we
turned to sea. Our dear cousins meanwhile remained
blissfully ignorant of our friendly visit to their shores.</p>

<p>The decks were cleared, but there was still no rest
for us. The storm was at its height, and the hour was
full of danger. In front of us, in the direction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
wind, lay the coast and the blinking lights of the boats
at anchor. Behind us were the mines we ourselves had
dropped, and into which we would infallibly drift if we
failed to maintain ourselves against the wind. Only at
four o'clock did we go forward once more, when the
first officer came to release me from my post after twenty-four
hours' strenuous duty. On the following day I
expressed my thanks to the crew for the good work they
had done.</p>

<p>It was well that we had our task behind us, for in
the days that followed we should have no opportunity
of carrying out our designs. For a whole week we
were battered about in the wildest manner, and had only
one thought&mdash;to keep the ship head-on to the raging sea.
There was no question of advancing. To avoid detection
I would have willingly gone farther away from the
coast, but this could not be done.</p>

<p>At last, however, the glass began to rise again and
we approached the coast for the second time. In the
feeble light of dawn a big steamer hove in sight.</p>

<p>At first, from her build, we took her to be a passenger
boat; then, as she seemed anxious to follow in our wake,
we began to have some doubts. When we saw that she
was painted grey, we jumped to the conclusion that she
was an enemy auxiliary cruiser, and one of the largest
at that. What a catch for us!</p>

<p>All eyes were fixed on me. Every man was anxiously
awaiting the command to fight. But the <i>Moewe</i> dare
not think of fighting yet. She dare not expose her
cards and reveal her next move, which was still mine-laying.
Even were the issue of the encounter to our
advantage, the wireless on board the other boat would
betray everything. Our chief aim must first be attended
to&mdash;all our mines must be laid&mdash;then only would the
<i>Moewe</i> be free to act as she pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>With mingled feelings we watched the big boat get
behind us. There was now some eight thousand yards
between us&mdash;a good firing distance.</p>

<p>Suddenly she veered away from us, as if satisfied with
her inspection. We could even hear her sending a wireless
to the nearest shore station, possibly to signal our
presence. Were this the case, painful results would certainly
ensue for us. I altered my course as soon as the
boat disappeared&mdash;it was better to avoid complications.
At full speed we steamed for the point where we had
decided to lay our next mines. This time the weather
was calm and clear.</p>

<p>At eight-fifteen, as we threw the first mine overboard,
some lights blinked into sight. They came from English
fishing-boats, and we avoided them with care. But
gradually the number of these boats grew to such an
extent that we could no longer evade them. The mines
tumbled into the water in their very midst, and though
every instant we feared detection, we continued our
exertions during the whole night without a hitch. Either
they took us for one of their own patrol-boats, or else,
after the way of good fishermen, they thought of nothing
at all. At six o'clock, our task satisfactorily completed,
we left the shores of England in dazzling sunlight, looking
forward to a couple of days' much-needed rest.</p>

<p>The first day the men took things easily, and only
the most indispensable duties were performed. The
news which we received daily by wireless told us that an
enemy man-of-war had run across a mine, and we would
have given anything to know whether the mishap was
due to one of the "eggs" the <i>Moewe</i> had laid. Subsequently
we ascertained that such was the case.</p>

<p>Something like sixty nautical miles separated us now
from the usual steamer-route.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE SHIP BOUND FOR BRAZIL</p>

<p>The next day, on January 11th, at ten in the morning,
a cloud of smoke was signalled. We went slowly towards
it. Presently, with glasses, we could make out
the tops of masts and the funnels of our first victim.
She must not escape us. Orders were sent to the engine-room
to give us as much speed as possible. When,
at last, we got a nearer view of the boat, we put her
down to be English, and about the same size as the
<i>Moewe</i>. As the distance between us diminished, a
second cloud of smoke came in sight on our other bow,
and grew rapidly larger and larger. Evidently a second
victim was flying into our arms! If the captain of this
second boat had been more considerate he would have
waited until we had at least settled with Number One.
Owing to his untimely appearance our task would be
doubly difficult. But we did not allow our spirits to
be damped. We simply slowed down in order to reconnoitre
the second intruder. This boat also turned
out to be English, of the same size as the first.</p>

<p>When she was sufficiently near, we hoisted the signal,
"What is your name?" The answer came: "<i>Farringford</i>."</p>

<p>The time for action had arrived!</p>

<p>As we saw that the boat to starboard was slower than
the <i>Moewe</i>, we first tackled the second intruder.</p>

<p>We signalled "Stop," and showed the German ensign,
and&mdash;to let both our neighbors see that we were in earnest&mdash;we
fired a shot. Both ships stopped immediately.
The <i>Moewe</i> steered towards the <i>Farringford</i>, and, at a
distance of fifty yards, I shouted: "Abandon the ship
immediately."</p>

<p>My intention was to take the crew on board; then to
approach the other boat and, finally, to sink both vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>But this was easier said than done. Owing to the
high seas, the transfer of the crew of the first boat was
somewhat difficult and took time; meanwhile, the other
ship utilized the opportunity to disappear in a dazzling
rainbow. I consequently gave up my first intention of
blowing up the <i>Farringford</i>. Instead, I ordered a few
shots to be fired at her. Two of these having struck the
water-line, and her sinking appearing to be imminent,
we were at liberty to pursue the fugitive at full speed.
Overtake her we must, for if she escaped us our detection
was a dead certainty. Presently the fugitive was
once more in sight. I sent a shell through the air, and,
with a great display of smoke, the steamer tried to increase
her pace; but a second shell recalled the captain
to his senses. He notified his intention to stop by
showing all his lights and three red lamps, and after a
two hours' pursuit we got alongside him.</p>

<p>A prize-crew of two officers and six men promptly
went on board. The first thing to be done was to ascertain
the owner of the boat and cargo. Then her papers
had to be examined and their accuracy verified. Finally,
the crew was reviewed and the cargo examined. The
results were duly signalled to the <i>Moewe</i>.</p>

<p>We were thus informed that she was an English steamer,
the <i>Corbridge</i>, three thousand six hundred and eighty-seven
tons, taking a cargo of four thousand tons of coal
from Cardiff to Brazil.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE LIVERPOOL TRADERS</p>

<p>This welcome capture meant another two months'
cruising for us! The <i>Corbridge</i>, therefore, was not
sunk, but received the order to follow in our wake,
after which we jointly returned to the spot where we
had abandoned the <i>Farringford</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of a brilliant moon, there was nothing to be
seen. Our shells had done their work well, and the ship
was at the bottom of the sea. We felt justly elated at
the success of our double capture on the very first day
of our hunting expedition.</p>

<p>The next twenty-four hours brought us nearer to the
usual shipping route, but nothing untoward occurred.
The crew of the <i>Corbridge</i> was reinforced and put under
special orders. Then she was released. I shall have
more to say about her later on.</p>

<p>The second morning after the sinking of the <i>Farringford</i>
another cloud of smoke was signalled. On this occasion,
too, we commenced by acting very cautiously,
for fear of the new-comer suspecting our <i>bona fides</i> and
signalling our presence by wireless. Having ascertained
that the boat had no wireless on board, however, we
steered straight for her. The captain, however, seemed
to have smelt a rat, and tried to evade us. Our intimation
to stop, accompanied by a shell, soon convinced him
of the futility of such an attempt. Sadly, he brought
his ship to a standstill. From the prize-crew I sent on
board we learnt that the boat's name was <i>Dromonby</i>,
three thousand six hundred and twenty-seven tons, and
that she belonged to the British Government, and was
on the way to South Africa with a cargo of coal. The
crew of fifteen men was transferred to the <i>Moewe</i>, and
the ship blown up.</p>

<p>Another cloud of smoke being signalled, the <i>Moewe</i>
got ready again.</p>

<p>This time also the boat was an "Engländer"&mdash;a specially
fine steamer, <i>Author</i> by name, three thousand four
hundred and ninety-six tons register, and worth three
to four million marks. After the usual formalities, the
crew, consisting of four Englishmen and forty-five Indians,
was taken on board our ship. We also transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
sheep, chickens, and eggs, and our larder was thus renewed
in a most satisfactory way. There were also
many valuable race-horses on board, but unfortunately
they had to be shot.</p>

<p>The weather remained calm. We worked busily, without
any fear of interference, until still another cloud of
smoke appeared on the horizon to the south. Completing
the transfer as quickly as possible, we turned all
our attention to the sinking of the <i>Author</i>. In the general
hurry, a mishap occurred. Three patent life-buoys
had inadvertently remained on board the <i>Author</i>, and,
just as we thought all was over, these buoys caught fire
from their contact with the water and suddenly exploded.
Had this noise been heard by the approaching steamer,
she would certainly have got alarmed, and might possibly
have escaped us. We therefore pretended to be
looking for a man overboard, and meanwhile secured the
buoys. The boat came towards us unsuspiciously, and it
is easy to imagine the painful surprise of her captain
when he received the brusque order:</p>

<p>"Stop at once and abandon your ship!"</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation he complied.</p>

<p>We ascertained, in the usual way, that the ship's name
was <i>Trader</i>, three thousand seven hundred tons, and that
she was bound with a cargo of raw sugar to Liverpool.
We sank her in a quarter of an hour, by opening her
valves and applying a few bombs. Practice makes the
master!</p>

<p>I summoned the three captains of the sunk boats to
the bridge, and made the seriousness of the situation
clear to them. I impressed upon them that, provided the
prisoners complied with all our regulations, they could
count on fair treatment, but that the slightest insubordination
would be followed by the severest punishment.</p>

<p>I must say that our prisoners observed my warning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in the most praiseworthy fashion, and in return they
were allowed, on favorable occasions, to air themselves
on deck, which they greatly appreciated, for the accommodation
set apart for them, where a hundred and fifty
men were huddled together, was insufficiently ventilated
and altogether inadequate.</p>

<p>The housing of the prisoners presented at first considerable
difficulties and caused the first officer no small
trouble and perturbation. Finally, the space where the
mines had been kept was set apart for the whites, while
the Indians were accommodated in the stern. Fortunately
we had sufficient wood to improvise makeshift
tables, benches, and so on. Gradually things began to
look more shipshape, but nevertheless we were very
anxious to get rid of this superfluous humanity at the
earliest possible opportunity, and before long the wish
was gratified.</p>

<p>Though we were close to a much-used trade route
during the whole of the following day, we did not catch
sight of a single vessel, and we utilized the time to repaint
once more the <i>Moewe's</i> sides, which sadly needed
a fresh coating.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF SINKING OF THE "ARIADNE"</p>

<p>The next morning, at seven o'clock on January 15th,
we met the British steamer <i>Ariadne</i>, three thousand tons,
with a cargo of maize. In the most obliging manner she
ran right into our arms.</p>

<p>The searching of the ship and the capture of the crew
were again carried out according to the prescribed rules,
and I decided to sink the abandoned ship in precisely
the same manner as the <i>Farringford</i>&mdash;by shelling her&mdash;as
this gave our gunners an opportunity of practising.</p>

<p>The chart house was chosen for a target, and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
after the first shell the ship caught on fire. Enormous
volumes of smoke filled the air. Glorious though
the sight was, we found it most provoking, for we feared
that the smoke might serve as a warning to some approaching
vessel. We waited patiently, or rather impatiently,
for fully half an hour, for the "passing" of the
<i>Ariadne</i>, but as she showed no signs of sinking we finally
decided to speed her on her way by sacrificing one of
our torpedoes. No sooner said than done! Very shortly
afterwards the <i>Ariadne</i> took her final plunge.</p>

<p>Almost immediately a cloud of smoke showed in the
distance, heralding the passage of a fast steamer going
north. We began preparations at once to hurry after
her, and, if possible, waylay her. While feverish preparations
were going on in the engine-room, we continued
our investigations. The speed of the vessel was a capital
point, for, assuming that we annexed her, her pace, provided
it turned out equal to ours, would prove an enormous
advantage. On the other hand, fast boats are
generally provided with wireless, and we ran the risk
of being signalled, in which case we would be compelled
to resort to drastic measures, a course we would rather
avoid with a passenger boat. Also, of course, the vessel
might prove to be an auxiliary cruiser, or even a man-of-war.
We approached her, therefore, very cautiously.
The first officer, who went aloft with his glasses, informed
us that the boat had only one funnel and very
big superstructures. That meant that she could only
be a passenger boat, or else an auxiliary cruiser. Still
very cautiously we approached her, and soon were practically
certain that we were in the presence of a passenger
boat, though her nationality remained doubtful, as
she carried no flag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF THE CAPTURE OF THE
"APPAM"</p>

<p>At a distance of about two thousand yards, I steered
in such a way that a collision was imminent, unless the
ship got behind the <i>Moewe</i>. At last we caught sight of
her name&mdash;<i>Appam</i>. Turning to the International Shipping
List, we read: <i>Appam</i>, English steamer of the Elder
Dempster Line, seven thousand eight hundred tons register;
carries passengers and has a wireless. That such
a big boat carried also a precious cargo we did not doubt
for an instant.</p>

<p>Without more ado, therefore, we hoisted the signal,
"Stop at once," and also showed our war-flag, in the
hope that the ship would abandon all thought of resistance.
But she disregarded our signal, and we had
to follow it up with a shell as a warning to the captain
and a reminder of what it means to ignore, in war-time,
the orders of a man-of-war.</p>

<p>Our shell had the desired effect; the <i>Appam</i> slowed
down considerably and, finally, stood still. A few seconds
later, I was told that her wireless was operating.
Immediately our own operators intervened in such a
way that the enemy's message became indecipherable.
At the worst, any ship hovering in the neighborhood
could only have been able to make out that something
unexpected was taking place. But even that was to be
avoided at all costs.</p>

<p>I therefore ordered a shell to be aimed at the wireless
on the <i>Appam's</i> bridge. It silenced the apparatus at
once, and the <i>Moewe</i> then got behind the English boat.
I next saw English man-of-war sailors in uniform in the
act of directing upon us small, quick-firing guns. Had
they really fired on us, it would not have been an act of
courage, but cold-blooded folly and reckless audacity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
for surely they must have known that their small guns
would have been quite inadequate against our far better
equipment.</p>

<p>It would have been, moreover, a distinctly criminal
act towards their passengers, for if we retaliated the
unarmed passengers would most certainly have come to
grief.</p>

<p>To end the critical situation, I quickly fired a second
shell over the heads of the firing brigade. We saw the
men scurry away, and then return to their posts and
resume their preparations for firing. This made my
blood boil and I ordered a few well-directed shells to
be fired straight into their midst. Then, at last, their
thick heads understood that we were in earnest. I
promptly dispatched two boats to the <i>Appam</i>, for we
now could see on board quite a number of English naval
uniforms. Her deck was getting more and more crowded
with people, who, in great excitement, were equipping
themselves with life-belts and moved in all directions
like a swarm of bees.</p>

<p>A striking contrast to this scene was presented by a
group of people leaning on the taffrail and making joyful
signals in our direction. We soon unravelled this
mystery. These people were our own compatriots&mdash;twenty-one
civilians, with three women, and eighteen
prisoners of war from the Cameroons police. They had
all been arrested in Duala, at the beginning of January,
and put on the <i>Appam</i> to be interned in England. Their
joy at their happy and quite unexpected release is indescribable,
and we naturally reciprocated and shared in
their delight.</p>

<p>I ordered them to be transferred at once to the <i>Moewe</i>,
and they joined us with shining eyes and smiling faces.
We celebrated the occasion by drinking to the health of
His Majesty the German Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>More and more satisfactory tidings came from on
board our capture. The ship was laden with a precious
cargo, which would compensate us amply for the risk
we had run in attacking a vessel provided with wireless.
Specially welcome was the news that the <i>Appam</i> was carrying
a million marks in gold. Without losing a minute
we transported this treasure to the hold of the <i>Moewe</i>.
It was comparatively light booty&mdash;eighteen cases in all;
sixteen cases of them contained fourteen bars of gold
apiece, and two gold-dust.</p>

<p>So far everything had gone splendidly. What, however,
was to be done with the four English officers, twenty
sailors and marines, and the hundred and sixty passengers
on board the <i>Appam</i>? To transfer them to the
<i>Moewe</i> was out of the question, every available corner
being occupied.</p>

<p>After some deliberation, I dispatched Reserve Officer
Berg, with a prize-crew of twenty men, to the <i>Appam</i>.
The released Germans were told to consider him as the
master of the ship and on every occasion to back him
up. That being settled, we hurriedly departed, for the
<i>Moewe</i> still feared the possible consequences of that
interrupted wireless message of the <i>Appam</i>.</p>

<p>Our next act was to ascertain what provisions the
<i>Appam</i> had on board, for my intention was to send our
captive into some port only after a considerable time,
for with our parting from her the secret of our existence
would naturally come to light.</p>

<p>At nightfall we stopped the ship, and I summoned the
captain, officers, and crew of the <i>Appam</i>, also the four
officers and sailors belonging to the British Navy. By
all laws and rights they were prisoners of war, and had
to join their friends below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF THE COLONIAL PRISONERS</p>

<p>The passengers of the <i>Appam</i>, our officers told me,
were literally trembling for their lives. I decided, therefore,
to have an interview with the two most representative
passengers, the Governors of the English colonies
of Sierra Leone and Nigeria&mdash;Sir Edward Merewether
and Mr. James. These two gentlemen, on being
conducted to my cabin, had the situation fully explained
to them. Fortunately for them, the German Colonials
on board the <i>Appam</i> had already informed me that both
these men, in striking contrast to the usual English
official, were not rabid German-haters, and had in the
prosecution of their official duties treated Germans comparatively
well.</p>

<p>I consequently informed them that, in spite of their
official capacity, I had no intention of detaining them as
prisoners on the <i>Moewe</i>. (The fact that, had I done so,
they would have been very much in our way, I, of course,
kept to myself.) I clearly saw that both these gentlemen
of high standing had expected a very different fate, for
their expression brightened at my words. They passed
a night on the <i>Moewe</i> and were conducted back to the
<i>Appam</i> the following morning, after breakfast, with instructions
to tell their fellow-passengers that the <i>Appam</i>
would eventually be brought into a certain port under
German command. Every passenger could keep his belongings,
but every eligible man had to sign an undertaking
not to bear arms in this war against Germany
or her allies. So long as the orders of the German officer
in charge were obeyed, everyone would be well treated,
and everything would be done to ensure the safety of
the ship. At the slightest sign of opposition or insubordination,
however, the vessel would be blown up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Appam</i> remained with us for the time being, as
the stocktaking of the coal and provisions lasted a considerable
time. The ex-captain had originally informed
us that his ship was only provided for another five days.
After some persuasion, he admitted that there was
sufficient fuel and food to last double that time. Consequently,
the ship could be taken to the United States
of America, the only country where we could berth our
prize.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF THE FIGHT WITH THE
"CLAN McTAVISH"</p>

<p>The following afternoon a cloud of smoke appeared
on the horizon. At closer quarters, we recognized a
fast steamer, provided with wireless, but without high
superstructures. We therefore jumped to the conclusion
that the vessel was an important cargo-boat.</p>

<p>It was already quite dark when we overtook her, and
I made use of the Morse lamp to ask for her name.
Her answer came promptly: "First tell us yours."</p>

<p>One name is as good as another, so I deemed it advisable
to usurp that of the sunk steamer <i>Author</i>.</p>

<p>After some hesitation, the stranger signalled with the
Morse lamp: "<i>Clan McTavish</i>."</p>

<p>Delighted to be again dealing with an "Engländer," I
ordered, without losing a second:</p>

<p>"Clear for battle to starboard."</p>

<p>The guns took aim, and I shouted:</p>

<p>"This is a German cruiser. Stop at once!"</p>

<p>"We have stopped," came the answer, but, though
four hundred yards divided us, we heard them working
with all their might to set their ship in motion. I fired
a shot, whereupon I was told that the enemy vessel was
using her wireless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Without wasting another second, I gave the order to
aim at the wireless, and the first shell silenced it. Almost
immediately, a streak of light pierced the darkness
and something hissed over our heads. At first I thought
I had made a mistake, but as a shell dropped into the
water quite close to the <i>Moewe</i>, there could be no doubt
that the Engländer intended to put up a fight.</p>

<p>We opened fire, and shot after shot rang out. But the
Engländer was tenacious. Her shots answered ours&mdash;strangely
enough, without once hitting us. That seemed
to exasperate her only the more, and thick smoke enveloped
us. Then, suddenly, the enemy ship slowed down
and she signalled:</p>

<p>"We have stopped completely."</p>

<p>Soon we were able to ascertain the damage caused by
our firing. Afterwards, the captain told us that our
first shell had killed a Lascar. The second shell went
through the cabin of the second officer, creating havoc
in that part of the ship. The third shot hit the captain's
bridge. Other shells killed seventeen Lascars and
wounded five. A shell having hit the water-line and
another the engines, the captain had at last given up
further useless opposition.</p>

<p>While the prize-crew went on board, I summoned the
<i>Appam</i> to help us. She had watched the fight from a distance,
and it is easy to imagine with what feelings.</p>

<p>The <i>Clan McTavish</i>, five thousand eight hundred and
sixteen tons, was bringing a considerable cargo of wool,
leather, skins, and india-rubber from Australia, worth
about ten million marks. How splendid if we could
have taken all that wealth home with us! Unfortunately,
we had damaged the engines of the <i>Clan McTavish</i> beyond
repair. All thought of the cargo had therefore to
be abandoned, especially as we were in a hurry to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
away&mdash;pursued, as usual, by the fear of a possible surprise.</p>

<p>So, two hours later, the <i>Clan McTavish</i> disappeared
into the deep sea, and, once more, we feasted our eyes
on the rare and suggestive sight of a sinking ship, rendered
even more attractive by a brilliant tropical moonlight
night.</p>

<p>Her crew consisted chiefly of Indians, who meanwhile
had been transferred to the <i>Moewe</i>.</p>

<p>One of our shells had hit a boat and killed fifteen poor
fellows. Three men, severely wounded, who had been
rescued from the water by the <i>Appam</i>, died during the
night.</p>

<p>When the captain reported himself to me, I took him
severely to task and pointed out to him that, by ignoring
my orders and entering into a useless battle with us, he
had unnecessarily caused the death of eighteen men.</p>

<p>By way of excuse, he replied that he had no idea that
our boat was a man-of-war; he had taken the <i>Moewe</i> to
be an armed merchantman, and thought his and our
chances were about equal. Moreover, he declared himself
free of all responsibility in the matter; his orders
had been to bring his ship to England. To that end he
was provided with a gun, and it was his duty to make
use of it when the occasion arose.</p>

<p>Frankly, I liked the loyalty with which this old Scotch
sea-bear defended his case. I shook hands with him
and admitted that, most probably, in his place, I would
have acted exactly in the same way.</p>

<p>Still in company with the <i>Appam</i>, after the sinking
of the <i>Clan McTavish</i>, we proceeded westwards. At
last, however, there came the day when I thought it was
opportune to part from Lieutenant Berg. He was instructed
to make for a port in the U.S.A., and I entrusted
to his care the civilian passengers of the seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
ships we had sunk up to now. Naturally, I would have
preferred to leave them in safe custody in Germany, but
the situation precluded this altogether.</p>

<p>Our primary object being to sink more ships, we needed
all our available space for future guests. So we only
retained on board the three officers belonging to the English
Army, twenty man-of-war sailors and marines, the
crew of the <i>Clan McTavish</i>, and a hundred Indians.</p>

<p>Before parting with them, I once more summoned the
captains of the seven captured boats and impressed upon
them that it was their absolute duty to preserve peace
and order on the <i>Appam</i>. They replied by assuring me
emphatically that the German commander would be
obeyed as strictly as they themselves had been.</p>

<p>Thus reassured, I let them go, yet it was not without
misgivings that I watched the <i>Appam</i> disappear below
the horizon. And, truly, it was no trifle to bring the
boat safely through the lines of the British cruisers in the
Atlantic, to the coast of the United States. Yet I knew
full well that Lieutenant Berg, like all the officers of
our merchant navy, was a master of his craft, able to
handle the most difficult situation. We learned with great
satisfaction about a month later, through a wireless message,
that the <i>Appam</i> had reached Newport News exactly
at the appointed time, without any undue complications.</p>

<p>The secret of the <i>Moewe</i> had been preserved!</p>

<p>Among our guests on board, the Indians were undoubtedly
the most interesting. Picturesque to a degree, not
only by their brightly colored attire, but even by their
demeanor, which possessed a rare dignity, their presence
was very welcome to me on board my ship. Yet, naturally,
I did not retain them solely for these æsthetic reasons,
but because I knew they could be very useful. In
the neighborhood of the Tropics there reigns an intolerable
heat, with intermittent downpours, and in the interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the ship the temperature exceeds the limits of
endurance. In such conditions Indians are invaluable.</p>

<p>We employed them principally as coal-heavers, for it
was impossible to use them in any other regular capacity,
as they only worked willingly when their customs and
religious ceremonies are not interfered with. Punctuality
in meals was an equally important point with them; in
the middle of their work they would throw down everything
and start cooking their mutton and rice, or rice
and mutton. No other food seemed to exist for them,
and our European fare they appeared to regard with
loathing. Sarang, the oldest among them, told me that,
so long as they had rice, they were willing to do any
work; but if rice failed them, they would all die, without
the slightest resistance. In consequence, every ship
we captured after this was thoroughly searched for rice
before it was sunk. Unfortunately, we never found
much of it, so that the rations of the poor Indians grew
more and more meagre. Yet, I am glad to say, Sarang's
sombre prophecy was not realized; every one of the Indians
survived this skimpy diet. Their good will was
invariable, no matter what they were told to do. Our
crew was now less numerous, as a good number of men
had been taken away to form two prize crews, and the
work was pretty hard, the cleaning of the ship and the
upkeep of the war material being no small matter, and
the Indians' help was invaluable.</p>


<p>IX&mdash;STORY OF THE "EDINBURGH" ON
VOYAGE FROM INDIA</p>

<p>The time had now arrived to renew our coal reserves,
and so we went in quest of our first prize, the <i>Corbridge</i>,
which the reader will remember was in charge of a prize-crew,
and had parted from us on January 12th. We expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
her now to have reached the appointed spot where
we intended taking over her cargo of coal. Late in
January we met a three-masted sailing-ship, the <i>Edinburgh</i>,
one thousand four hundred and seventy-three
tons, on her way from India to Liverpool, carrying two
thousand tons of cattle food in the shape of rice-flour.
This ship, whose unlucky star placed her in our way,
had already been twenty-one months at sea, and for an
incredibly long time had lain becalmed in windless latitudes,
waiting for a propitious breeze. Now, when the
wind had actually risen and the <i>Edinburgh</i> could at last
escape from the broiling heat and the inexpressible dullness
of endless waiting, the <i>Moewe</i> appeared and shattered
all her hopes!</p>

<p>We pitied the poor old captain, who was sixty-seven
years old; but war is war! He and his crew had to
take up their quarters with us, and their ship had to bid
a hasty adieu to this world. The cattle will wait for
their food in vain.</p>

<p>The following day, on January 28th, precisely at the
appointed time, the <i>Corbridge</i> loomed in sight and joined
us where we were lying at anchor. The transfer of the
coal took fully three days. Heat, noise and coal-dust
were everywhere; there was no getting away from it.
But it was glorious to watch the zeal with which the crew
toiled away. The unloading of a cargo of coal is never
a small affair, and the <i>Corbridge</i> lacked everything that
might have made the task easier. Every moment we
were confronted with new difficulties, but they were always
solved by some obscure inventive genius from
among the crew. Ingenuity coupled with good will can
achieve much. Night and day the men labored unremittingly,
until the precious black stuff was stored carefully
in every available corner on our boat.</p>

<p>As a last souvenir of the <i>Corbridge</i> we appropriated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the pigeons and the pigeon-house erected on the bridge.
Subsequently, these delightful birds helped us to while
away many a pleasant hour, when, on perfectly calm
days, they fluttered about the ship.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Corbridge</i>, we had got out of her all we
wanted, and she was presently sunk in the usual way.</p>

<p>Now that the <i>Moewe</i> had once more a supply of coal
we felt like different beings, and pined for fresh deeds.</p>

<p>Yet we had to be more cautious than ever, for, surely,
the disappearance of so many vessels within a few weeks
would serve as a hint to our enemies that all was not
as it should be in the Atlantic.</p>

<p>That this was so was proved to us, if only by the fact
that the game we were hunting was now conspicuously
rare. In vain did we search the zone usually overrun
by ships. Not a single cloud of smoke came in sight!
At last we decided to leave the beaten track and seek
for our quarry elsewhere. After much patience, and a
certain amount of good luck, we finally succeeded in
making fresh victims. As ships were evidently taking
every precaution against us, and were attempting by all
possible means to evade us, we retaliated by resorting
to new stratagems&mdash;the continual repainting of the
Moewe, in order to vary her aspect as much as possible,
being the most frequent one we adopted.</p>


<p>X&mdash;STORIES OF SHIPS ON BOTTOM OF THE
SEAS</p>

<p>Our first capture on this occasion occurred on February
4th&mdash;a Belgian boat, the <i>Luxembourg</i>, four thousand
three hundred and twenty-two tons register, with a
cargo of five thousand nine hundred tons of coal, the
property of a railway company in Buenos Ayres. Considering
the high price of coal and freight, this cargo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
alone was worth about a million marks. Yet cargo and
ship promptly disappeared into the depths.</p>

<p>The crew of the Belgian ship consisted of the most varied
types of humanity. The majority were neutrals,
chiefly Greeks and Spaniards, and their transfer to the
<i>Moewe</i> was rather a comical affair. They were hampered
by the most unnecessary paraphernalia&mdash;mandolins,
parrots, zithers, monkeys, dogs, and so on.</p>

<p>On February 6th we captured another vessel, the English
steamer <i>Flamenco</i>, four thousand six hundred and
twenty-nine tons register. She met our advances by
using her wireless. We retorted with a few well-directed
shells, and this quickly brought her to her senses, especially
as she had caught on fire. The crew rushed to the
boats, one of which upset, and about twenty men fell
into the water. This is no joke in this region, where
sharks abound, and we were genuinely pleased when our
prize-crew succeeded in fishing all, save one man, out
of the waves.</p>

<p>While preparations were being made to sink the <i>Flamenco</i>,
I summoned her captain and remonstrated with
him for having used his wireless, an act which had provoked
us into firing. He replied that his duty was to
thwart our plans, just as much as mine was to capture
his boat. One of the neutrals transferred on board the
<i>Moewe</i> confirmed our suspicion that we were being
tracked. He told us that the English cruiser <i>Glasgow</i>
had overtaken them the previous day and had warned
them of the danger of an encounter with the <i>Moewe</i>.</p>

<p>At first we were inclined to doubt the story, for up to
now we had neither seen nor heard of this cruiser. On
developing some photographic plates seized on board the
<i>Flamenco</i>, however, we made the acquaintance of this
English cruiser. We must have unwittingly passed each
other in the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>We continued our voyage in splendid weather, though
the heat was insufferable. Good luck was slow in coming.
But one afternoon, shortly after five, we caught
sight of a vessel, and quickly went in pursuit. She
proved to be the Norwegian <i>Estrella</i>, so we let her go.
On this occasion we once more changed the aspect of the
<i>Moewe</i>.</p>

<p>For days after that we only saw flying-fish, water, and
passing clouds. But on Sunday, after having the whole
day in vain searched the horizon, towards evening we
perceived a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>We hurried forward, but, unfortunately, it was quite
dark before we overtook the steamer.</p>

<p>Our request for her name remained for a time without
an answer. Then came the reply: "<i>Heraclide</i>."</p>

<p>This was disconcerting, for Lloyd's Register contained
no such name. We repeated our question and received
the same answer:</p>

<p>"<i>Heraclide</i>."</p>

<p>"What nationality?"</p>

<p>"Good friend."</p>

<p>"What line?"</p>

<p>Deep silence.</p>

<p>Now we knew how to act. If the boat had claimed to
be a neutral, I should have let her go unmolested. On
the other hand, a neutral would never have given such
an equivocal reply, so, of course, she could only be an
"Engländer."</p>

<p>I ordered her to stop.</p>

<p>While we slowed down, the steamer suddenly accelerated
her movements in an evident attempt to escape.
That put an end to my patience. We sent a shell in
her direction, and I heard the captain ironically inquire:</p>

<p>"What did you shoot at?"</p>

<p>He must have realized, though, the seriousness of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
position, for he forestalled a second shell by signalling
with the siren that he had stopped. The boat's name
now became apparent. She was English, and, as we had
rightly surmised, the <i>Westburn</i>, a comparatively old
boat of three thousand three hundred tons, with a cargo
of coal and a speed of only seven knots.</p>

<p>That Sunday our hopes were destined to be fulfilled
a second time. While the crew of the <i>Westburn</i> was
being transferred to the <i>Moewe</i>, a white light showed on
the horizon. We swiftly got ready, and, adapting ourselves
to the course of the <i>Westburn</i>&mdash;which was in tow&mdash;we
steamed towards the new-comer.</p>

<p>At six o'clock in the morning we ran alongside of
her. She proved to be the steamer <i>Horace</i>, three thousand
three hundred and thirty-five tons, with a particularly
rich cargo of spirits, grain, wool, meat, and antimony&mdash;all
things that Germany is in great need of. Yet
it was out of the question even to attempt to send this
prize home, as she was deficient in coal. There was
nothing for it but to sink her and all she contained.</p>


<p>XI&mdash;STORY OF THE EXPLOSION ON THE
"WESTBURN"</p>

<p>We had now so many mouths on board to feed that
it was imperative to get rid of them. The <i>Westburn</i> was
requisitioned for this purpose, and all our guests, with
the exception of those whom we considered prisoners of
war, left the <i>Moewe</i>. There were some hundred and
fifty in all, and they were anything but comfortable in
the old boat during their enforced voyage to Teneriffe,
where the prize-commander&mdash;the officers' orderly, Badewitz&mdash;was
instructed to conduct them. The prize-crew
consisted this time of only eight men. On this occasion,
too, I summoned the captains of the six captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
ships and impressed upon them that, at the slightest
sign of insubordination, or attempt at mutiny, Commander
Badewitz had my orders to blow up the ship.</p>

<p>Later, I learned from the papers, that the <i>Westburn</i>
arrived in broad daylight at Santa Cruz, in Teneriffe.
A few hours earlier, the big English ironclad <i>Sutlej</i>,
twelve thousand two hundred tons, had dropped anchor
in the harbor. When the German war-flag, proudly
fluttering at the stern of the <i>Westburn</i>, was noticed by
the <i>Sutlej</i>, the <i>Westburn</i> was already inside the three-mile
zone in Spanish waters, and her arrival could not
be hindered. It was arranged with the harbor authorities
that the prisoners should remain on board until the
following morning, and the prize-commander gave them
once more to understand that, at the slightest offence
against discipline, he would blow up the ship. So, in
spite of the presence of the English warship, the prisoners
had the sense to remain quiet. The next morning
they were partly landed and partly taken on board English
ships, while, early in the afternoon, the <i>Westburn</i>
left the harbor to avoid being detained by the authorities.</p>

<p>Outside, the <i>Sutlej</i> was lying in wait, eager to pounce
upon her presumed prey the moment she left the three-mile
zone. Hardly had the <i>Westburn</i> steamed out of
the harbor, however, than she was seen to be surrounded
by a white flame. The ship swayed to one side, while
the crew rushed to the boats.</p>

<p>According to the papers, one of the boilers, all of
which were in a wretched condition, had burst. Whether
true or not, this incident played into our hands. It was
very considerate of the ill-fated boiler to explode just
at the precise moment when the <i>Westburn</i> was liable
either to be seized by the Spanish authorities or pounced
upon by the English vessel. It was far better for us
that the cargo of four thousand tons of coal should go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to the bottom of the sea rather than that it should be
utilized by an English ship.</p>

<p>The very next day after parting from the <i>Westburn</i>
we caught sight of another steamer. After a four hours'
pursuit we ascertained that she was a neutral, and we
slunk away in the darkness, hoping we had not been
recognized.</p>


<p>XII&mdash;STORY OF THE "MOEWE'S" PREY&mdash;AND
RETURN HOME</p>

<p>Our next encounter was with a big, stately passenger-ship,
which, unfortunately, we could not waylay.</p>

<p>The time was now fast approaching when it became
necessary to think of returning home. The nights were
growing shorter, and the season of winter storms being
at an end, we ran a greater risk of being captured.</p>

<p>On reaching more northerly latitudes, we received glad
tidings from home more and more frequently by wireless.
A special joyful occasion was when news reached us
that fifty men of our crew had been granted the Iron
Cross.</p>

<p>On February 24th one more valuable prize fell into
our hands&mdash;the Frenchman <i>Maroni</i>, three thousand one
hundred and nine tons, with a cargo of wine, on its way
from Bordeaux to New York. Thirty-three Frenchmen
were transferred on board the <i>Moewe</i>, but the ship, of
course, was sunk, and with her&mdash;much to our chagrin&mdash;a
thousand cases of Pommery. We could not get at
them quickly enough, for they were packed away securely
in the hold. But we carried away innumerable
eggs, fine French cheeses, and many other provisions
we had long been obliged to do without.</p>

<p>A specially welcome find on the <i>Maroni</i> was the newspapers.
Our cruising-campaign had inspired many indignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
articles, and we perused them with much zest.
"Pirate" was the mildest of the terms applied to us by
the French press.</p>

<p>Still further pleasure we derived from the reading of
the English and American papers seized on the next and
last boat we sank&mdash;the British steamer <i>Saxon Prince</i>,
three thousand four hundred and seventy-one tons, carrying
a cargo of wool, grain, and explosives from America
to England.</p>

<p>We learnt from these papers of the great impression
produced on the marine insurance companies by the
disappearance of the first boats we captured. Many
conjectures were made, but not one of them approached
the truth. The possibility that a German cruiser had
broken through the British lines in the North Sea did not
occur to anyone, until the <i>Appam</i> reached the United
States and her passengers gave authentic accounts of
that quasi-fabulous bird of prey called the <i>Moewe</i>.</p>

<p>Long-winded articles told us how Lieutenant Berg had
loyally and conscientiously fulfilled his share of the joint
task by retarding as much as possible the bringing of
his ship into port.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine with what pleasure we welcomed
the good tidings concerning our adopted daughter, the
<i>Appam</i>, and how gratified we felt when even the enemy
paid tribute to Lieutenant Berg's energetic and tactful
handling of the situation.</p>

<p>After that the <i>Moewe</i> made straight for home, her
good star once more enabling her to get safely past all
obstacles. As a reward for their services, every member
of the crew was given the Iron Cross of the Second
Class, and the Commander was summoned by the great
War Lord himself to come and tell him all the details
of the sinking of the hated "Engländers."</p>

<h2>PRISONER'S VOYAGE ON GERMAN
U-BOAT UNDER THE SEA</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Comfort, Even Gayety, Aboard Craft</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by (Name Withheld by Request)</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Much of the mystery and rumor surrounding German submarine
methods is cleared away by this narrative of a steamship officer
who spent many days as a prisoner on one of the powerful
new U-boats. His story was written for the <i>New York Times</i>
on condition that his name be not disclosed. Treated with great
consideration by his captors, he had an opportunity to learn
how the officers and crew lived, to study their attitude and
manners, their work with torpedoes and deck guns, their system
of attack and defense, and their science of navigation. It is
reproduced here by permission.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE MYSTERIOUS CAPTURE</p>

<p>This is a true record of actual experience as prisoner
on board a German submarine. The ship I left may be
called the <i>Wanderer</i>, and to the submarine I will refer
as the "U-boat."</p>

<p>All went well till one day the first intimation of any
danger around was hearing a shot fired, and in a few
seconds a shell hit the water a little distance from the
ship. The weather was good and sea calm and no craft
was discernible, though lookout men were watching&mdash;and
I draw attention to this to show that, in spite of precautions,
it is difficult to recognize a submarine on the
surface, with her conning tower painted the color of the
water, at a range of three to four thousand yards. Very
shortly a second shot was fired, whereupon through the
glasses a conning tower became visible and also men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
standing on the deck, so we became aware that a submarine,
evidently a big one, was on our track. We then
stopped, return fire being impossible and to run away
useless, as we would soon have been overhauled.</p>

<p>Presently a flag signal was hoisted from the periscope,
which read: "Send an officer here with your ship's papers."
Pushing off in a small boat, I was soon aboard
the submarine, where I was at once taken down below and
questioned by the commander as to the name of the ship,
owner's name, nationality, where from, where bound for,
and nature of cargo. After a few minutes' conversation
a young officer hurriedly entered the cabin and informed
the commander that he thought a patrol boat
was in sight. The commander promptly ordered some
other prisoners to be brought up, placed in the <i>Wanderer's</i>
boat and pushed off. Presumably this was done
at once, for presently I could hear what sounded like
hatches on deck being quickly lowered and a buzzing
sound, which I knew afterward was due to the lowering
of the periscope.</p>

<p>In a few seconds all was still, and we had submerged.
The whole affair happened so quickly that I could
scarcely realize I was now a prisoner in a submarine,
and as I thought of my shipmates my only consolation
seemed to be that the <i>Wanderer</i> was safe enough, for
the present at least. Left alone to myself in a small
cabin, I wondered what was going to happen next and
what was going to be the end of it all. Being told not
to leave my cabin, I obeyed and, as I felt somewhat
dazed and confused, took off my coat and lay down on
my bunk.</p>

<p>Thoughts crowded through my head, and I had an almost
irresistible impulse to get out of the inclosed narrow
space and speak to some one, no matter who. This
was denied me for two hours, (which seemed like as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
many days,) when the commander called me into the
saloon, was quite cheery, told me not to be frightened,
that we were a long way from the original scene, that we
were on the surface, and that we were all safe again.
To me the consolation sounded strangely ironical, but he
was evidently in earnest and wished to put me at my
ease.</p>

<p>"Where is the ship?" I had to ask.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble," he replied. "She has gone off all
right and there is nothing in sight."</p>

<p>Presently two more of the U's officers entered the
saloon and we sat down to our first meal, which consisted
of preserved meat, biscuits, butter, tinned tomatoes,
marmalade, coffee with milk, and a glass of port
wine to finish. My appetite was not good, but the fare
was wholesome enough, and my hosts, knowing I could
understand German, conversed cheerily. For the most
part I answered only when spoken to, asking no questions
lest I might be thought inquisitive, but taking in
everything. Here let me say that officers and crew set
out from the start to make me comfortable and feel at
home; were hospitable, courteous, and kind in every way,
and put no special restrictions upon me.</p>

<p>The commander frankly told me to ask him any questions
I liked about the boat, and that if he sometimes
made no reply that I was not to take further notice of it.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said he, "there are one or two things I
do not want you to see, but you must not mind that, and
as to the war or what is going on, we will not talk of it."</p>

<p>So that what I saw or heard aboard passed the censor,
so to speak, so far as the U officers were concerned, and
I formed no opinion that they willfully gave me any false
information. I am not clear yet as to their motive in
taking me prisoner at all, as I was of no use to them and
only took up room and consumed food. Nor could it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
have been worth their while to "terrorize" one individual
like myself. Of course, I carefully refrained from touching
on this point, nor did I ask what they intended to do
with me if we got safely to port, preferring to remain
silent and patiently await developments.</p>

<p>When on deck for fresh air I saw no land anywhere,
nor did I expect to be allowed to see it, and probably
if I had I should not have been any the wiser. Nor was
I shown any charts or allowed to make any periscope
observations, although on some occasions I was asked
to retire to my cabin, mostly around noon, when navigation
was being worked out. The course we took I
never knew, and the only clue I had to position was
one day when, to my relief, I was informed they hoped
to land within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>First, as to the U-boat herself: She was about 250 feet
long, had a crew of about 35 men, carried two 4&frac12;-inch
guns, could steam 18 knots on the surface and 11 below
if required, and had a range limit of 3,200 miles steaming
at 12 knots on the surface.</p>

<p>Leaving Germany she was stored for a twelve-weeks'
cruise; when I joined her she had provisions only for a
few more days as prisoners previously captured had consumed
some of them, hence their anxiety to get rid of
the remaining ones sent off in a hurry in the <i>Wanderer's</i>
boat. The original stores were preserved pork and
beef, vegetables, tinned soups, fruit, raisins, biscuits, butter,
marmalade, milk, tea, and coffee. Prior to sinking
one ship they had commandeered eggs, fresh meat, butter,
vegetables, and some liquor to afford variety to the
larder; so that the bill of fare was varied and there was
no stinting of rations. Any cooking was done on an
electric stove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF LIFE ON THE SUBMARINE</p>

<p>The U was driven by petrol, but they said colza or
benzoline or any kind of machine oil not too thick could
be used, and if this could be replenished from any captured
ship so much the better. I would have liked to
know about any of the supply ships which undoubtedly
have a secret rendezvous with these submarines, and also
about land bases in some of the neutral countries so-called,
but this information was, of course, denied me.</p>

<p>The living quarters were small but comfortable, officers
having separate small cabins and the crew bunks with narrow
alley way in between. Ventilation was surprisingly
good, pipes for the purpose running all through the boat,
foul air being extracted by exhaust and fresh air driven in
four or five times a day for half an hour at a time while
on the surface.</p>

<p>More than once I remained below for more than twelve
hours and did not suffer from headache or symptoms due
to bad air. Sometimes we were submerged for four
hours, sometimes longer, once for close on fourteen
hours, but I felt little inconvenience. The officers stated
that up to twenty-four hours of continual submersion
they were fairly comfortable; after that, for six hours, it
was uncomfortable, and subsequently became intolerable,
due to the "sweating" from the framework of the
boat, which rendered the clothing damp. To obviate this,
leather suits were worn mostly during prolonged submersion,
and this process was perhaps the most disagreeable
experience of all. For purposes of ventilation, therefore,
and in order that the crew might remain in good
health, as well as for necessary locomotion, the U remained
as much as possible on the surface both day and
night.</p>

<p>The idea that most of the submarines come inshore at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
night and lie at the bottom in bays is quite a wrong one&mdash;perhaps
at the beginning of the war, when the boats were
smaller, they may have done so; but the larger ones for
choice avoid the shallower water and keep out in deeper
channels. Safety to themselves prompts such procedure,
for they are quite alive to the danger of nets and explosive
bombs dropped from the air and surface of the
water. When homeward bound and nearing their own
shores they often lie at the bottom all night and wait for
daylight before proceeding for fear of encountering English
patrols or destroyers. With their own war craft
they have special flag signals by day and Morse flashes
by night. The larger U's have wireless installation by
which in code they can communicate with each other, but
their range of transmission is short.</p>

<p>The sanitary arrangements below were good and much
the same as on any liner. A petty officer was in charge
of the sanitation, who also was first aid ambulance man,
had charge of the medicine chest, and when required
acted as a gunner&mdash;quite a handy man. There were two
good lavatories on board, effete matter being expelled by
force pumps at any time. Other than drinking water
there was scarcity of fresh water for domestic uses, so
there was no chance of a fresh water bath, another of
the drawbacks experienced, although sponging off in cold
salt water is at all times refreshing.</p>

<p>There was a variety of books to read, comic and other
papers, among them two English papers nearly three
weeks old; a gramophone and several records, so that we
had music, singing, and occasionally dancing for exercise'
sake, but no smoking below, which was strictly forbidden
and was perhaps the greatest hardship of all.</p>

<p>There was thus a little gayety on board to relieve the
monotony, although, truth to tell, I found the voyage an
exciting one and my shipmates seemed merry enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
In fact, I was surprised at myself getting used so quickly
to the new life, and am bound to confess that I was no
more worried about what was going on above the surface
of the water than I had previously been on my own
boat about what takes place at any minute from under
the water.</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE HALE AND HEARTY
CREW</p>

<p>The crew on board were quite self-composed, jocular
for the most part, serious enough in what they were out
to do, but not worrying much about the risks thereof,
nor did they seem to regard their calling as any more
hazardous than on any other war craft in dangerous waters.
Being all young men, full and fond of adventure,
the incitements seemed stimulating to their nerves, and
victims they looked on as legitimate prey and with no
feelings of remorse. The reports I had heard that men
in Germany had to be forced into the submarine service
seemed to amuse them immensely. On the contrary, they
declared there was any number of volunteers for the
work, and that many young officers were willing and glad
even to pay a premium to get on a "sub" in preference
to other war craft, where they said the routine was harder
and more irksome.</p>

<p>What their pay was I did not hear, but I gathered it
was good, and that provision in the way of bonuses for
"good work" and pensions for their dependents were allowed.
The idea, too, that at the end of a cruise they
were all so nerve-racked that they needed a long rest
they declared was too absurd. Many U-boats, they said,
made consecutive voyages after a short spell in port to
store up, and their "rest depended entirely on the emergencies
of the moment."</p>

<p>I must say that on parting with them I saw no signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of any breakdown, either physical or mental, although all
of them looked for a holiday, which is a sailor's privilege.
Sailors, we are told, are proverbial for their modesty
and the unassuming way they talk of themselves,
but this trait I failed to discover in the U-boat officer,
who was boastful enough of the great work he was doing
for the Fatherland and quite callous as to the methods
employed in so doing.</p>

<p>I saw little or nothing of the actual manipulations
during submersion, but they were probably on the usual
lines known to all such boats and about which there is
no particular secret. Every foot of submersion is indicated
by a handle turning around on a disk as on the
face of a clock, the chief care being not to sink too deep.
I gathered this boat could easily be out of sight in less
than ten seconds, and steam 11 knots at 60 feet below
the surface, 7 knots at 90 feet, and was tested to sink
to 200 feet, below which depth there was danger of the
sides of the boat being driven in from pressure of the
water. At 50 feet below the surface, while in motion,
there was little movement or vibration to be felt; at 80
feet practically none at all, and the stillness became
monotonous.</p>

<p>During the voyage one ship was torpedoed, but they
prefer shelling for economy's sake, although they had
plenty of shells aboard and did not stint them in attacking
one sailing ship. During the torpedoing process I
was surprised how little concussion was felt below&mdash;in
fact, beyond a slight "bumping" sensation I might not
have known it at all.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF THE TORPEDO ROOM</p>

<p>Of torpedoes on board there were eight "large" and
eight "small," as they called them, which when discharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
liberate their own propeller and shoot along at
some ten feet below the surface at a rate of up to forty
knots an hour, occasionally "breaking surface," i.e., coming
up higher and throwing jets of spray in their course
and then submerging again.</p>

<p>It appears that 55 per cent, or more than half, of the
torpedoes fired miss their mark, and with this average
they seem satisfied. Once they let go at a ship two torpedoes
at 3,000 yards' range, and both missed, the range
being too long; but they did not care to come any nearer,
as they believed the ship to be well armed.</p>

<p>They prefer to fire at 500 to 700 yards, which means
that at this range the track or "wake" of a projectile
would be discernible for, say, twenty-five to thirty seconds&mdash;not
much time, indeed, for any ship to get out of
the way. At 100 yards' range or less they do not care
to fire unless compelled to, as the torpedo is nearly always
discharged when the submarine is lying ahead of
the object, i.e., to hit the ship coming up to it; it follows
that a gun forward is more useful than one aft, the gun
aft being of real service when a submarine starts shelling,
which she will do for choice from aft the ship rather
than from forward of her, where she would be in danger
of being run over and rammed.</p>

<p>Owing to the big expense of wasted torpedoes it had
been planned to build special larger U-boats, two-deckers
carrying larger guns for shelling purposes&mdash;hence the
sooner all merchantmen are well armed the better for
them.</p>

<p>Talking one day of the number of submarines lost, the
officers declared that the Allies' reports of their captures
and sinkings were much exaggerated. Naturally they
would say so, but the truth is probably best known at
headquarters, where such figures are checked up. Once
or twice when on the surface we were fired at at long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
range and quickly submerged, although the U crews
recognize they are a difficult target to aim at, let alone
hit, as I, too, knew from experience.</p>

<p>The periscope is about seven inches in diameter and
moves up and down like a piston rod in a cylinder, accompanied
by a buzzing kind of sound, which became familiar
after a day or two. If required it can reach
seventeen feet above the surface and may be used as
a flagpost for signals. At its summit is a mirror, three
to four inches in diameter, from which images are reflected
to a larger mirror below used by the observer.</p>

<p>When a ship is first sighted the chief point is to determine
her course, which may be easy if she is going in
the same direction, but more difficult if not. The next
point is to determine as near as possible the speed of
the object ship, the size and general lines being considered,
and deductions drawn. Next, the distance away
of the approaching ship has to be noted.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances on board ship the nearer
one standing on deck is to the water the more limited
will the horizon be, and likewise the higher from the
water, as in the "crow's nest," the bigger the horizon.
Standing on deck, seventeen feet from the surface of the
water, the horizon, on a clear day, would, roughly speaking,
be three miles. The same rule practically applies
in periscope work, which, as it can extend seventeen feet
in the air, will give a three-mile horizon vision. Therefore,
according as is the position on the horizon rays,
so will the distance away of the object ship be gauged.</p>

<p>The course, speed, and distance off being calculated,
the U has then to man&oelig;uvre get into position for
firing, taking care to avoid the actual track of the approaching
ship and to get nearly "broadside on" to her.
Hence there is nothing worries them and upsets their calculations
more than when the ship alters her course frequently&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
man&oelig;uvre being called zigzagging&mdash;and
which accounts largely for the high percentage of misses
registered. The more often the alteration of course takes
place, the bigger and more uneven the zigzag, the better
for the ship.</p>

<p>Daylight is most suitable for torpedo firing, but there
is nothing to prevent its being accurate enough during
moonlight, even so far as minor work is concerned. As
the torpedo can be discharged from the surface as well as
when submerged, the precaution of having every light
on the ship extinguished is a necessary one. It is remarkable
how few collisions at sea have taken place during
the war, even though the ships are running without
any navigation lights and even during fog no whistle is
sounded. The periscope being in those days a "familiar
object," it is believed that some of the later U-boats have
another device in the shape of a small hatch opening upward
which can be opened by the observer on the submarine,
enabling him to look around the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>Ordinary navigation on the U-boat is done on usual
lines, i.e., sextant and compass and bearings from landmarks
by day and observation by stars and of lighthouses
by night, but the reckoning of distances by dead reckoning,
that is, on the log, has to be dispensed with. The
compass used is a gyroscopic one, so there is no deviation
due to magnetic influence, and the courses are all
therefore "true courses."</p>

<p>There were no signs of any soundings being taken
while submerged, but of course they were frequently
taken from the surface while approaching land. While
on the surface, if the sea was at all rough, the U rolled
considerably and the officers, in oilskins, were lashed to
the nearest stanchion to prevent being washed overboard.
On the for'ard deck on either side of the bow was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
small anchor about the same size as used on a 500-ton
ship.</p>

<p>The personnel of the U-boat consisted of a commander
and three officers, a commander engineer and three officers,
several petty officers and ordinary crew, all of
whom were young men. Each department had its own
section to look after, a full log was kept of all that went
on aboard as in peace times, and discipline throughout
was excellent.</p>

<p>So much for my cruise in the U-boat, which was satisfactory
enough as an experience and certainly on the lines
of all's well that ends well. With my queer underwater
shipmates I parted on quite good terms, impressed not
a little with their general courage and mostly with their
coolness under conditions which required steady head
and hands and observation which called for considerable
cunning and resource.</p>

<p>Compared with a small submarine of the early type
I found this U-boat so vastly improved that it was hard
to realize so much advance had been made in so short a
time; and if it be true that practice makes perfection,
there is no knowing what further developments are in
store for this class of war craft.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before concluding I must refer to certain cruises made
by U-boats across the Atlantic to America. Much fuss
was made about these and the performances were called
"marvelous," "astounding," and so on. From experience
I fail to see anything wonderful about them. Once the
submarines navigated clear of the north of Scotland, the
rest of the voyage was plain sailing for the modern
U-boat as I saw it&mdash;and, in fact, the voyage for those on
board must have been simply a restful and pleasant holiday
run.</p>

<h2>THE DARKEST HOUR&mdash;FLEEING
FROM THE BULGARIANS</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Our Experiences in the Great Serbian Retreat</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Alice and Claude Askew</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A vivid narrative, by eye-witnesses, of the supreme tragedy
in the history of gallant little Serbia. Mr. and Mrs. Askew
went to the country as members of a Field Hospital, and, with
the Staff of the Second Army, took part in the terrible retreat
across the mountains into Albania. "Little we thought," write
the authors, "that it would prove to be the Via Dolorosa, the
stony road to Calvary, of an entire nation." Original stories
told in the <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE FLIGHT FROM PROKUPLJE</p>

<p>We were surprised when we were told by one of our
friends on the staff of the Second Army that we must
prepare to leave Prokuplje that very evening.</p>

<p>"Why," we cried, "only a few hours ago we were told
that the Bulgarians have had a bad set-back!"</p>

<p>"So they have," was the quiet rejoinder. "The Bulgarians
won't get here in a hurry. But the Germans
may."</p>

<p>Which goes to show that at this period the Serbian
Army was putting up a gallant fight against foes that
were bearing down upon it from all sides. What was
the good of beating back the Bulgars when the crushing
force of the Austro-Germans, with their heavy artillery,
had also to be reckoned with? If it had been only the
Bulgars!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the immediate source of danger
was not so much that Prokuplje would fall as that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
road to Prishtina&mdash;the only route open to the retreating
army&mdash;might be cut. Koshumlja was threatened, and
if Koshumlja were to be taken we should all be caught
like rats in a trap.</p>

<p>We had come to Prokuplje from Nish, and all the
time we were there&mdash;over a week&mdash;there was heavy fighting.
Had the promised assistance come even then, at
the eleventh hour, the tide might have been stemmed, the
tables turned, for the Serbian successes were by no means
to be despised. The famous Morava division of the Second
Army had covered itself with glory in a tough battle
at Mramor, Lescovatz had been retaken, and the Bulgarians
had been driven out of Nish. The latter victory,
however, proved useless, for the Germans immediately
stepped in their place.</p>

<p>And in spite of all this, Prokuplje must be evacuated.</p>

<p>We liked Prokuplje&mdash;it is a pleasant little town very
picturesquely situated. Moreover, we had comfortable
quarters in what we were frequently told was the "finest
room in the town."</p>

<p>We were always being envied our luck in finding accommodation.
Generally speaking, it was abominable
beyond description, but the man who sleeps in the open
air will envy him who has a roof over his head, and he
who lies upon bare boards may be excused if he covets
his friend's mattress.</p>

<p>A friend of ours, coming to visit us at Scutari, was
stopped by an acquaintance in the street and asked where
he was going. He mentioned our name.</p>

<p>"Oh, those are the lucky people who did so well for
themselves at Plavnitza," was the grudging comment.</p>

<p>Had we been asked we should not have agreed that
we did well for ourselves at Plavnitza; indeed, the night
we spent there was not far off being the worst in all
our varied experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF OUR NIGHT AT PLAVNITZA</p>

<p>In the first place, we had no desire to stay there at all.
We were waiting for a steamer to take us to Scutari,
but a violent storm had arisen and the steamer failed to
appear. Furthermore, we were not actually at Plavnitza,
but upon the quay, the best part of half an hour's walk
from the village along a sort of embankment that was
swept by wind and rain and where the mud was so deep
and sticky that it needed courage to face it.</p>

<p>There were many people in the same plight as ourselves,
but when it became a matter of certainty that the
steamer was not going to show up they returned to the
village and sought accommodation there for the night.
No doubt a large number were disappointed.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we stayed where we were&mdash;on the quay.
We had found shelter of a kind, and we were not disposed
to give it up to someone else on the remote chance
that after ploughing our way through the mud again we
might find something better at the village.</p>

<p>There was only one building on the quay, a storehouse
for goods delivered by the steamer. Just now
there was nothing doing, and the doors were locked.
There was, however, a small room, with a dirty narrow
bed in it; it was occupied generally by the watchman, but
he happened to be absent that night. He had left his
son in charge, a sickly, pale-faced boy of fourteen or
fifteen, who never ceased smoking cigarettes, and who
had the manners and conversation of a grown man.</p>

<p>It was in this room that a crowd of us sought refuge
from the storm, and here, when most of the others took
their departure, we elected to remain. Our small host
was very kind&mdash;he gave up his bed to us&mdash;but it was
quite beyond his power to make the general conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
anything but disgusting in the extreme. We shiver still
at the recollection of them.</p>

<p>Our young friend had been lavish in his hospitality,
and so we shared the room with some half-dozen men&mdash;excellent
fellows, but whose habits could hardly commend
them as companions for the night. The fact that
there was a lady in the party made no difference to them
at all.</p>

<p>Oh, the atmosphere of that room! It was redolent
of stale fish, cigarette smoke, and the smell of foul garments
sodden with rain. The storm that raged outside
made it quite impossible to open door or window.</p>

<p>It was very cold, and we, like the rest, had been
drenched to the skin, but, of course, we could not think
of removing any of our wet clothes. We were faint for
want of food, too; expecting to reach Scutari that night,
we had brought but little with us, and that we had consumed
at midday. But in that f&oelig;tid atmosphere we
could not have eaten much, however richly supplied we
might have been.</p>

<p>Our little host sat on a box and smoked and talked
with his other guests for the best part of the night. It
was the same with them all. When they were not smoking
and spitting they were eating dried fish and cheese,
the order of which was sickening to sensitive nostrils.</p>

<p>The boy was bare-footed, and his clothes hung about
his wizened, deformed body in rags. They were palpably
verminous, and, knowing this, we shuddered for
the bed upon which we lay. Nevertheless, the poor little
fellow was so cold when at last, like the rest of the company,
he stretched himself out on the filthy floor to
sleep, that we were impelled to give him one of our coverings,
ill as we could spare it.</p>

<p>We had but a small fragment of candle, which spluttered
to its end somewhere in the early hours of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
morning. After that we lay, sleepless, in total darkness,
listening to the moaning of the wind outside and the
contented, unconcerned snoring of our companions. And
there was a great fear upon us&mdash;that the coming of day
might not bring us relief, for if the storm continued, as
was by no means unlikely, the steamer would be indefinitely
held up, nor could any rowing-boat venture forth.
If there had only been a road to fall back upon! But
there was none.</p>

<p>We shall not easily forget our night upon the quay at
Plavnitza, and it certainly never occurred to us that we
were likely to be envied the experience!</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE LAST HOURS BEFORE
RETREAT</p>

<p>But to return to Prokuplje, where we occupied "the
finest room in the town"&mdash;which meant that it possessed
a fairly comfortable bed, carpet, curtains, and abundant
decoration upon the walls in the way of Berlin wool-work
and cheaply-framed photographs. We were sorry that
we had to leave it in such a hurry, though, perhaps, we
should have regretted our comfortable quarters still more
had it not been that our host had elected to slaughter
three large pigs that day in the yard just beneath our
window, and so all the resultant processes were thrust
upon our unwilling view.</p>

<p>The administrative staff of the Second Army were
leaving Prokuplje that evening, so we were told; the
operative staff would take its departure early the following
morning and probably, for strategic reasons, follow
a path across the hills instead of the main road. There
would be room for us in one of the cars, and we were
to be informed by the orderly of our friend, Captain
Gworsditch, aide-de-camp to the staff&mdash;who himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
would be absent till late that night&mdash;at what time we were
to hold ourselves in readiness. No doubt it would be
about six o'clock, certainly not later than seven. With
luck it should not take us more than twenty-four hours
to make Prishtina, whither we were bound, but the road
in places was very bad, and so we must allow for longer,
and if we had not provisions enough in hand for the
journey, it would be wise to lay in some more.</p>

<p>We reviewed our stock. We had bread, cocoa and
tea, a bottle of Greek brandy, sugar, and three tins of
sardines. Thinking things over, we calculated that if
we had a good dinner before we left we should require
nothing more; if all was well we should dine the following
night at Prishtina.</p>

<p>We did not know that we were shortly to be under
famine conditions. True, we had had difficulty with our
meals at Prokuplje, but this was not so much due to a
shortage of supplies as to the fact that we had no one
to cook for us. The young woman of the house was extremely
lazy, and used to protest that it was as much
as she could do to look after her father and the children.
Nevertheless, she spent half her time gossiping in the
street, for which, not unfrequently, her father would
thrash her, and, as, in retaliation, she would bully her
little brothers and sisters, the whole house used often
to resound with ear-splitting and most discomforting
howls. So it happened that our food, which was brought
to us every morning, uncooked, by Selam, Captain
Gworsditch's orderly&mdash;we did not have our own orderly
till later&mdash;might, or might not, be attended to; if it were,
it was usually so badly cooked as to be uneatable; if it
were not, we had to do the best we could with it ourselves,
which was generally even more fatal in the result.
Eventually, however, we found a cook who was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
clever in spite of the poverty of material at her disposition.</p>

<p>But we were very remiss in failing to purchase
supplies while they were still to be got, and we suffered
for it&mdash;not only upon the journey to Prishtina but afterwards,
for Prokuplje was the last town upon our route
at which preserved foods, chocolate, biscuits, and such-like
necessary articles of consumption were to be purchased.
And even at Prokuplje they were getting scarce;
the last tin of sardines we bought came from the private
store of the chemist; all the other shops were sold out.</p>

<p>We waited patiently that evening for the arrival of
Selam, who was to take us to our car, and we did not
worry till eight o'clock struck and he had not arrived;
even then we were not particularly concerned, for we
concluded that the staff must have postponed their departure.
But that was not so; Selam had mistaken his
orders, and we were left behind!</p>

<p>We learnt this when, about nine o'clock, Captain
Gworsditch himself appeared, having found out that
there had been some mistake. He was terribly worried
for it was absolutely necessary for us to get off at once&mdash;yet
what was to be done, since the cars had already started,
all the carriages were requisitioned and at that time of
night and in the pressure of flight it was impossible to
arrange for horses? There was one at our disposition,
our beloved charger Pigeon, but we were two people and
we had some luggage as well. It seemed as if we must
walk or travel by ox-wagon, but anything of the sort
was decidedly dangerous as it was imperatively necessary
to pass Koshumlja with the smallest possible delay.</p>

<p>For two hours, with Captain Gworsditch, we beat the
town in search of a conveyance, and at last luck befriended
us. We found some motor vans that were going to
Prishtina with a heavy load of petrol, and the officer who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
was arranging the consignment happened to be a cousin
of Captain Gworsditch. It was arranged that we should
travel in one of the vans, and so we were hurriedly packed
in with some half-dozen other refugees, and by midnight
we were off. It was by no means comfortable, and
sleep was impossible because of the jolting of the car on
the rough road, but we comforted ourselves with the reflection
that we should not have another night of it. We
were traveling at a fair rate&mdash;not till the following day
did we realize that that was because we had started late
and the great mass of traffic was in front of us.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF JOURNEY TO KOSHUMLJA&mdash;AND
THE KING</p>

<p>We reached Koshumlja at about eight in the morning
and remained there for a couple of hours. We had fondly
imagined we should find an inn of sorts where we
could obtain some breakfast, but there was nothing of
the kind, nor could we purchase any food or wine, as we
had relied upon being able to do. We were, however,
most hospitably entertained by the family of the local
chemist, whose shop we had merely entered to make some
small purchase. They gave us bread, cheese, sausage,
and coffee, had our muddy boots cleaned for us, and
generally provided for our comfort before we started
off again. They were genial, kindly folk, true Serbs, and
later on we had frequent occasion to contrast their hospitality
with the rough and money-grabbing methods of
the Montenegrins.</p>

<p>They told us a lot of interesting things, among others
that a few days earlier they had been asked by the local
authorities to prepare a meal for a couple of distinguished
travellers. No names were mentioned. They had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
as they were bid, and were now quite sure that it was the
King himself whom they had entertained.</p>

<p>On leaving Koshumlja that morning we ourselves saw
the King. He was riding with a small retinue, hardly
an assumption of state, and to one of us particularly
the little cavalcade had something about it that was
infinitely pathetic. A brief quotation from one of our
diaries will explain why:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At Koshumlja to-day we saw the King. Curiously
enough this is the first time that I have come across him
since I have been in Serbia, though Alice saw him at
Tarpola. He is a fine old man, and trouble, sickness,
and age have not bowed him. And meeting him thus my
mind goes back&mdash;how many years it may be I should be
afraid to guess. I was a small boy spending my holidays
with my people at Vevey, on the Lake of Geneva, and
at the hotel we struck up an acquaintance with Prince
Peter Kara Georgevitch. He was then in the prime of
life, tall, dark, handsome&mdash;not yet married. He used to
talk to us quite unaffectedly of his hopes and ambitions.
King Milan was, of course, the prime enemy.</p>

<p>"'One day I shall come into my own.' I can quite
well remember him saying that.</p>

<p>"And it was true. Destiny&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;gave
him the coveted throne. And now, a dozen years
later, he has lived to see a fresh shuffle of the cards.
How they will fall it is still for time to show."</p>

<p>We made but poor progress that day, and it was not
to be wondered at. The congestion of traffic was amazing.
It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that
from Koshumlja to Prishtina there was an unbroken
stream of vehicles of the most varied kinds, though the
ox-wagon predominated enormously. With these were
soldiers and civilians on horseback; soldiers and civilians
on foot; oxen laden and unladen; pack-horses; buffaloes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
donkeys, and mules; dogs on the leash or running with
their masters; men, women, children, and beasts jostling
each other in the confusion of hurried flight. It was not
so much the retreat of an army as of a whole nation.</p>

<p>Yet all was orderly and in the main good-tempered.
The soldiers were kept to their respective "trains," and
were well under the control of their officers. There
were as yet no ghastly roadside sights, but now and
again came presages of what was to be&mdash;the fall of a
tired horse, the overturning of a cart, and once we were
sickened by seeing a couple of frightened oxen, with
wagon attached, precipitate themselves over the low
parapet of a bridge into the torrent that flowed below.
There was little or no excitement, and the empty space
was rapidly filled up; it was not well to fall out of rank,
if one could help it.</p>

<p>We soon gave up hope of reaching Prishtina that
night. Midday to-morrow, the chauffeur promised us.
In this confidence we consumed two of our tins of sardines
during the day&mdash;it was not much for lunch and
dinner&mdash;leaving the third for breakfast. And therein
lay a catastrophe, for when we came to open the tin,
hungry after another wakeful and uncomfortable night,
the contents proved to be hopelessly bad! We made a
meal off dry bread, and it did not improve our tempers
to see our companions devour a pig's head between them.
There was something revolting in the way they picked
the bones.</p>

<p>That day progress was slower than ever; we did not
seem able to make any headway at all. By midday we
could scarcely have advanced half-a-dozen miles. It
became increasingly clear that we should have to spend
a third night among the petrol-cans&mdash;if not a fourth and
fifth. That was bad enough in itself, but what about
food?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Our companions did not seem to mind a bit. They
were in no hurry and, considering that they had lost
practically all they possessed in the world, wonderfully
cheerful. But we were anxious to get to Prishtina and
rejoin our friends who might be concerned about us;
we were nervous on their account, too, since, though
there had been no attack upon the main road, we had
heard a great deal of firing going on among the hills,
and we knew that the route by which they proposed to
travel came at times&mdash;especially at the old Turkish
frontier which we were approaching, very near our
own.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF WHAT THE BULGARS DID</p>

<p>It was near the frontier, as we learnt afterwards, that
the staff had a very ghastly experience. They came,
quite unexpectedly, upon the mutilated bodies of some
fifty men&mdash;Serbs, not regular soldiers, but transport-bearers
and drivers&mdash;practically unarmed. They had
been massacred by Bulgars, a skirmishing party that had
been shown a path across the mountains by some treacherous
Albanians, and which had fallen unawares upon
the unfortunate Serbs. The brutality of the Bulgars
upon this occasion&mdash;brutality as to which there can be
no doubt whatever&mdash;was on a par with all the other
stories that have percolated through.</p>

<p>They tied their unfortunate victims&mdash;defenceless men,
be it remembered&mdash;hand and foot and then proceeded
to slash them to pieces with their swords. Having perpetrated
these murders and secured all the booty that
they could carry off, they escaped by the same way that
they had come.</p>

<p>No punishment could be meted out to them, but it is
good to know that the treacherous Albanians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
caught and promptly shot, while their houses were razed
to the ground&mdash;a more drastic punishment still, according
to local views.</p>

<p>No wonder we heard firing among the hills!</p>

<p>About midday we determined to abandon the lorry
and to make our way on to the next village&mdash;some dozen
miles&mdash;on foot. We did not feel disposed to face another
night of discomfort, but what put the finishing
touch was the introduction into the car of a little live
pig that was destined to be a new travelling companion
until such time as he should be killed, cooked, and eaten.
We had no food left of our own, but we felt that we
could never regale ourselves upon that pig.</p>

<p>We found an officer friend who gave us a couple of
soldiers to carry our baggage, and we set out to thread
our way through the stream of traffic; but we did not
walk very far, for coming presently across a carriage,
empty except for a load of forage, we determined to
commandeer it. The driver informed us that he belonged
to a cavalry division attached to the First Army,
and if his commandant had no objection to our intrusion
he, for his part, had none either.</p>

<p>Presently the commandant himself came along. He
knew us by repute, as did most of the other officers, and
the result was that we were cordially invited to ride
with the division and offered hospitality and refreshment
for the night.</p>

<p>It was, however, well after seven o'clock and dark by
the time we had crossed the old frontier and descended
upon the broad plain of Kossovo. Having practically
had nothing to eat or drink all day&mdash;and very little the
day before&mdash;we rejoiced when at last camp was reached
and we found ourselves sitting beside a huge wood fire&mdash;it
was bitterly cold&mdash;waiting for our supper to be cooked
for us and for our tent to be pitched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>We did not reach camp, by the way, without some
excitement. Out of the darkness there suddenly came
the sound of shooting uncomfortably near. Our friend
the commandant was riding by our side at the moment;
he apologized and galloped off sharply. Then came
more shooting. We learnt afterwards that it was a
case of Albanian snipers, and that due punishment had
been meted out.</p>

<p>Our supper consisted of "confection," as the tinned
meat provided to the army is called. When cooked it is
quite good, as each tin, besides the meat, contains an
ample supply of soup. We had Nestlé's milk, too, and
now for the first time we learnt to appreciate this commodity
at its true value. What we should have done
without Nestlé's later on it would be hard to say. Our
friend was very apologetic about the entertainment he
was able to offer us, and kept repeating that it would
have been very different in other circumstances; but we
were able, with absolute truth, to assure him that we had
rarely enjoyed a meal so much.</p>

<p>We might have added: "or slept so well." We were
accommodated in a little "dog-kennel" tent, but there
was a comfortable mattress and plenty of wraps, and
though the rain fell in torrents during the night, it did
not affect our rest. We only felt a sense of rejoicing
that we were no longer wedged in among the petrol
cans, cold and uncomfortable, and in unavoidable proximity
to uncleanly companions&mdash;not forgetting the pig.
As a matter of fact, had we remained in the lorry we
should have been another three nights <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>Our kind friend's hospitality did not end with the
night. The carriage was placed at our disposition the
next morning, and starting at six o'clock we reached
Prishtina by noon. There was no breakfast in camp for
anybody, but we were provided with <i>peksimeat</i>, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
hard army biscuit is called, water, and cognac as we
drove along.</p>

<p>And as we came to Prishtina our spirits revived, and
we told each other that, after all, there was still hope
for Serbia. There would be a concentration of the three
armies upon the historic plain of Kossovo, and perhaps,
if things were well in the south, a junction might yet be
established between the Serbs and the Allies. It would
be a grand thing, we argued, if Kossovo should once
again be the scene of a tremendous battle&mdash;Kossovo
which is already the centre of all that is best in Serbian
legend and story&mdash;and if at Kossovo Serbia should vindicate
her honour and re-enter into possession of her
own!</p>

<p>Perhaps at Prishtina our flight would find its end!
Alas, for such sanguine views; our stay at Prishtina
was destined to be short, and when once again we set out
upon the weary road of retreat it was to find the wayside
scattered with dead oxen, dead horses&mdash;and dead men.
At Prishtina Serbia entered in earnest upon her road
to Calvary.</p>

<h2>A MAGYAR PALADIN&mdash;A RITTMEISTER
OF THE HUSSARS</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Along the Road from Poland to Budapest</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Franz Molnar, Celebrated Hungarian
Dramatist</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The character sketch is from the pen of Franz Molnar, the
celebrated Hungarian dramatist and correspondent in the field
of the <i>Budapest Az Est</i> and the <i>Vienna Neue Freie Presse</i>.
This war has been a war of anonymity. Its vastness has submerged
individuals and individualities. It is the more interesting,
therefore, to catch now and then some impression of personality
and to find some figure standing out clearly and picturesquely
from the mass. In Rittmeister Farkas, Molnar has
drawn from life a character which epitomizes the romance of
the war. This story is translated, and the introduction prepared
by William L. McPherson in the <i>New York Tribune</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE GUERILLA WARRIOR</p>

<p>One evening I notice in front of the General Staff
Headquarters some General Staff officers in conversation
with a little officer, two heads shorter than any of them.
The little officer wears a dark hussar's jacket; his breast
is covered with decorations, conspicuous among them being
the Iron Cross. The diminutive but well set-up hussar
is continually being embraced and patted affectionately
on the back. He talks loudly and merrily. I hear
that he has visited headquarters in the interest of one
of his fellow hussars.</p>

<p>"You must stay here for supper!"</p>

<p>He stays. I sit opposite him and take a good look at
him, for I have already heard much about him. The
Army Corps Hoffmann is very proud of him; he is our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
guerilla leader, a legendary hussar type&mdash;Clemer Farkas
de Also-Takach. Formerly he was Rittmeister of the
14th Hussars. Now he is commandant of the cavalry
detachment of the army corps, the "Detachment Farkas."
He has as many cavalrymen as an Oberst has in peace
time. Therefore, his hussars call him "Herr Oberst Rittmeister."
He has hussars, uhlans, dragoons, Ukranian
volunteers&mdash;altogether a most daring collection of riders
and fighters. Nearly all the cavalry regiments of the
monarchy are represented in it. The organization is a
good counterpart of the Hoffmann Army Corps, which
has been constructed in a somewhat similar fashion.</p>

<p>The Rittmeister has a marked resemblance to a peppercorn.
He is very small, very hard and very strong. A
handshake with him is an athletic exercise. His glance is
clear and open, like that of a ten-year-old boy. You can
hear him laughing over the next hill. He cannot tell
stories; nor will he. All that he told me was that his
veterinary had saved the life of a little girl, taking twenty-three
splinters of a Russian shell out of her body, and
that thirty-six members of his family were in the field.</p>

<p>Rittmeister Farkas won his fame in Galicia. A Cossack
sergeant rushed at him and tried to spit him with a lance.
Farkas broke the lance under his armpit and then crushed
the sergeant's head with the butt of a revolver. He gave
the lance to the Heir Apparent. That was his first exploit.
Then came his first "action." He is posted one
day in Russian Poland with his hussars as support behind
the artillery. A heavy Russian shell explodes in his
neighborhood, and as it throws up the earth it uncovers
a telephone wire. Farkas notices the wire, takes hold
of it and follows it. The hussars dig up the ground over
it and find that it leads to a farmhouse. They dig no
further and conceal themselves.</p>

<p>Near the farmhouse is a well. Every few minutes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Russian peasant comes to the well, works the draw pump
and calls something down into the depths. They seize the
peasant and he turns out to be a Russian soldier in disguise.
Farkas takes his favorite sergeant, Galambos, and
three hussars, gets a long, stout rope and slides, with his
four men, down into the well.</p>

<p>A yard above the surface of the water he finds a stone
shelving and under the shelving an opening, which leads
into a dark tunnel. Now everything is cleared up. This
region was once an artillery practice field; no wonder that
it is so nicely fitted out. They push into the tunnel and
come to a telephone cell, in which three Russians sit by
candlelight before a modern field telephone. From there
the Russian field artillery is directed according to the
information shouted down the well.</p>

<p>Farkas throws his revolver away. One of the Russians,
knife in hand, hurls himself upon him. Farkas
seizes the wrist of the Russian and breaks it, for he is a
master of jiu jitsu; he instructs his men constantly in
Japanese ring methods. Two Russians are killed. The
one with his wrist broken confesses that the telephone
cell is a signal station and that the little detachment is a
signal patrol. He also delivers to Farkas a textbook
containing the A B C of more than 300 light signals.
Light signals are given with lamp groups, which consist
of two, five or eight lamps. They can send almost any
kind of news.</p>

<p>Farkas clambers up out of the well and makes good
use of the book. With his hussars he goes every night
on the hunt for light signals. Whenever at night the
combination of two, five or eight lamps is in use signal
patrols are killed or captured. It is plain that the Russians,
before the war, must have instructed 30,000 to
40,000 people for this service. Many of these people
worked in peasant clothes behind our lines in Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
territory. Farkas hunted down these signal devices in
farm houses, windmills, in the midst of swamps and in
the tops of trees. With ten to fifteen hussars he soon
made 140 of them useless. In this region the Russians
lost all interest in signal giving. Farkas had many times
done his work on horseback; oftener he had crawled on
his stomach. To his comrades he said that he had at last
got some profit out of the many pictures of daring adventure
which he had seen in the kino shows.</p>


<p>II&mdash;TALES OF FARKAS&mdash;THE HUSSAR</p>

<p>The Herr Rittmeister has taken a pledge; while the
war lasts he will not drink, gamble or hunt. Of these
three hunting is his only real passion. He would hate
to be a bad shot. In the wall of the Nyiregyhazy barracks
he shot his monogram with a pistol: thus, C. F.
They made him pay for the damage to the wall. Rittmeister
Farkas is therefore the only man in the country
who has ever, out of his own pocket, built part of a
barracks.</p>

<p>Once from a local train, which was running through
the hunting preserve of a friend, he saw a deer. He
pulled the emergency signal, shot the deer and then said:
"Now go ahead!" For that he was put under arrest in
the barracks for thirty days. Now, however, every one
of his bullets belongs to the Fatherland, and his iron will,
his daring, his mobile spirit, his technical skill, his great,
romantic heart, encased in his small steeled body, belong,
all, all to the Fatherland.</p>

<p>The Rittmeister wept when he heard that the Russians
stood before the Bereczke Pass. He did everything in
his power to get to that threatened point. So he became
attached to the Group Hofmann, which in the fall of 1914
drove the Russians out of Berog and Marmaros.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>About Christmas time in 1914 he is fighting in the
Carpathians. On December 19 he climbs, with his hussars,
the Vehikzi Brh Mountain, 1,600 metres high, and
at night descends with them, in snow up to the arm-pits,
to Firelopfalva, on the other side. He leads the march
and kills the Russian outposts. The Russians are driven
out of the village, losing 150. He cannot bring away the
Russian weapons, so he collects them in a pile and burns
them.</p>

<p>The Russians, who know him well, send three battalions
of infantry and four companies of Cossacks
against him. Three days long, until December 22, he
stands off, with a few hundred cavalrymen, all their
attacks. Then he sends his people back, remaining the
last one on the spot. He keeps a uhlan sergeant with him
to hold off the Russians until his troop has crossed the
mountains. The two hide behind a rock. Farkas takes
up his Mannlicher, with a telescopic sight. Suddenly the
sergeant receives a bullet in his calf. Farkas would
gladly retire, but he cannot carry the sergeant with him
and will not leave him in the lurch.</p>

<p>About 10 a.m. the Russians begin to climb in skirmish
line up toward him. At 10 o'clock Farkas, from behind
his rock, shoots down his first Russian; at 4 o'clock in
the afternoon his sixty-seventh. Up to the neck in snow,
without a bite to eat, he keeps all assailants at bay. At
5 o'clock it is pitch dark. Farkas goes away, returns in a
sled and carries off the wounded sergeant.</p>

<p>The Germans he likes very well, and they like him. A
German general said to him: "Explain to me, please,
what the rôle of Hungary is in this war."</p>

<p>Rittmeister Farkas showed his outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Excellency," he said, "if this war is a box on the ear
which we are giving the enemy, then in this five-fingered
box on the ear Hungary is not the least important finger."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>He is assigned for six weeks to the German Guard and
receives into his detachment some Prussian cavalry. Between
Uzok and Bereczke he climbs with them over the
mountains and holds for six days, with 500 cavalrymen, a
line southeast of Turka against 5,000 Russians, with
seven cannon and ten machine guns. His cavalry troops
form on the hill surrounding the Russian position.
Farkas stands in a church tower from which he can see
the enemy. He has three small flags&mdash;a green one, a
yellow one and a red one. When the Russians develop to
the left he puts the green flag out of the tower window.
Then the cavalrymen on the hills to the left fire. He
waves the right wing flag and other troopers fire from
the right. The Russians turn about and then the yellow
flag is hoisted and the fire comes from a third direction.
Thereupon the Russians intrench themselves in a half
circle at the entrance of a narrow pass; for they believe
the enemy menaces them from three directions. While
Farkas plays his tricks with the Russians the Prussian
Guard accomplishes its work.</p>

<p>Farkas may now retire. On the way he meets a German
sergeant major with fifteen or twenty infantrymen.
He halts them.</p>

<p>"Listen," says Farkas, "I have been here for six days
covering the Prussians so that they could march quietly.
Reciprocate, please, and cover my troops."</p>

<p>"Glad to do it," answers the German.</p>

<p>So he develops a line with his twenty men in order
to hold the Russians back, while Farkas withdraws his
troopers.</p>

<p>For this Turka exploit the latter gets the Iron Cross.</p>

<p>The commandant of the Prussian Guard, General
Baron Marschall, says goodby to him in a personally
written letter and calls him a "brilliant Hungarian hussar
officer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>He has already three slight bullet wounds, the tuft has
been shot away from his shako, his pistol holster has
three bullet holes (I am almost embarrassed to write this
down, for it sounds like a copy of a romance of Dumas),
his Attila is pierced in three places. There are two holes
in his breeches, his shako is split from the top by a sabre
stroke and one of his spurs has been shot away. Otherwise,
God be thanked, he is unharmed. I am not confident
that the reader will believe all of this. But it is
sufficient that several thousand men here know that it is
true and that I also know that it is.</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE KNIGHT OF THE ARMORED TRAIN</p>

<p>Rittmeister Farkas is a little wonder of the war; he is
so unique, original and incredible in his way that I had to
examine many documents and official reports before I
was absolutely convinced of the truth of the stories about
him. In November, 1914, he receives from Peter Hoffmann,
who loves him like his own son, a gift especially
suited to his adventurous character&mdash;two armored trains.
Then he is happy. Naturally he steams with both behind
the enemy's front, lets one run through a tunnel and stop
near its exit, so that nobody can attack it, and starts
back with the other to a certain factory building in which
a Russian regiment is quietly enjoying a midday meal.
With his single cannon he shoots off the factory chimney,
which falls into the crowd of diners below. The regiment
is panic-stricken. Then the armored train fires
with four machine guns into the regiment, plants seven
shells in the officers' quarters and creates such a confusion
among the Russians that they arrive at Bereczke a
week later than they had planned to arrive. Then he
returns the armored trains to His Excellency with thanks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
A little sadly he looks after them; for they were "as if
made for him."</p>

<p>Meanwhile he constructs machine guns and creates a
machine gun section and a section of mounted pioneers.
Now his detachment has machine guns and pioneers. He
looks out for all technical details and understands them
all.</p>

<p>"In geography I know nothing," he says; "I know
only thirty kilometres in front of my nose, but I know
those kilometres well."</p>

<p>His pride is that he has never eaten before his men
have. Once, however, he ate nothing after his men had
eaten. On the crest of the Carpathians the Russians shot
one of his horses. He let the cook make goulash out of
it for the men, but he ate none of it. "Not because I
couldn't stomach it, but because I loved the horse when
he was alive." He preferred to remain hungry.</p>

<p>I talked with his troopers. They never speak his name
without standing at attention. Out of curiosity I ask:</p>

<p>"Why are you so fond of him?"</p>

<p>They look at me and smile embarrassedly&mdash;old Landsturm
men, with big mustaches, fathers with many
children.</p>

<p>"We are everlastingly fond of him."</p>

<p>At last one of them gives this explanation:</p>

<p>"He leads the fight well."</p>

<p>So I learn that once in the Carpathians, when everything
came to a standstill because the Russians delivered
a terrible fire and there was no cover, he lay on the
ground before them and cried:</p>

<p>"Here I am&mdash;as cover for you. Lie on your stomachs
and fire from behind me!"</p>

<p>Complaints, which I sometimes hear, are directed not
against him, but against his business management. At
the first he paid twenty-nine kronen for each Cossack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
captured and five kronen for each Russian infantryman.
The troopers, whom he has led in almost 200 fights and
skirmishes, brought the Russians in so eagerly that prices
fell&mdash;and fell very sharply. A Cossack went down to
four kronen and an infantryman down to one kronen.
Not because the Cossack is worth four times as much,
but because he has a horse.</p>

<p>To-day, at noon, Rittmeister Farkas left us. God
knows when I shall see him again. Tiny, clever, good-hearted,
brave Rittmeister Farkas, mathematician, marksman,
bridge builder, locomotive driver in one person,
doctor, chaplain, letter writer and brilliant commandant
of lonely, middle-aged soldiers, daring Herr Oberst-Rittmeister
Farkas&mdash;a little red hussar's cap which becomes
smaller and smaller in the dust of the road&mdash;you give
me so many things to think about that at night I can
hardly go to sleep.</p>

<p>Who is able to explain these men to those for whom
they have been fighting for more than a year?</p>

<h2>OUR ESCAPE FROM GERMAN
SOUTH-WEST AFRICA</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Corporal H. J. McElnea, late of the Imperial
Light Horse, South Africa, and set down
by J. Christie</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>An echo of General Botha's brilliant campaign in German South-West
Africa. Captured by the Germans during a skirmish,
the author gleaned some information concerning the intentions
of the enemy. Night and day he schemed to get away in order
to give his superiors the news. Finally, with three companions,
he essayed the task of escaping from the military prison at
Franzfontein and making his way for over two hundred and
fifty miles through a terrible region of uninhabited mountains
and desert to Swakopmund, where the British forces were in
occupation. Lack of food and water, suffering of body and
mind, blistering heat and extreme cold&mdash;the author experienced
them all during his nightmare journey, which he related in the
<i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE IMPERIAL LIGHT HORSE</p>

<p>My squadron of the Imperial Light Horse, which had
been operating for several months with Luderitzbucht,
German South-West Africa, as a base, finally left on
13th December, 1914, with the Natal Carabiniers and
two machine-guns. We went to Rooikop, where we
camped for the night, and the following morning
marched on to our advance camp at railhead. Here we
found some infantry and mounted men belonging to the
Kaffarian Rifles and Nesbitt's Horse. The force
marched out from railhead at sundown, trekked all night,
and arrived at Tchukaib at two o'clock in the morning.
About half-past seven in the evening of the same day,
after having watered our horses, we marched out, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
left all spare kit, greatcoats, mess-tins, and so on,
in camp. We travelled until about one o'clock in the
morning, when we off-saddled, linked horses, and lay
down to rest. In about two hours' time we got orders
to up-saddle and move on. Strict orders were given
not to strike matches, or make any unnecessary noise.
We arrived within sight of Garub Station just before
daylight on December 16th, 1914, and halted behind some
kopjes for about half an hour or so.</p>

<p>During this halt most of us discarded our tunics and
strapped them on our saddles. We then marched on,
keeping to the north of the railway line, until about a
mile beyond the railway station, where we passed the
pumping-station, which had been completely destroyed
by the enemy.</p>

<p>My troop (No. 2, D Squadron, Imperial Light Horse)
now got orders to trot up in front of the column. We
crossed the railway line and proceeded back towards the
station, on the south of the line.</p>

<p>We were next instructed to march towards the kopjes
to the southeast, and my section was sent in front, scouting.
I rode on about six or seven hundred yards in
front of the troop, and then I noticed some other men
being sent forward, so I took the right flank with my
section. We now crossed three sand-dunes. In crossing
the third I noticed some fresh spoor, which indicated
that the enemy had passed shortly before towards the
kopjes in front. Just as we neared the top of the fourth
dune a single shot rang out, and almost immediately
after the Germans opened a murderous enfilading fire
from rifles and machine-guns. I gave orders to my section
to retire, and we galloped towards our troop, but
had only covered about a hundred yards or so when my
horse got hit and I fell heavily on my head.</p>

<p>How long I remained senseless I am unable to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
but when I regained consciousness I found I was not
alone. Trooper Joyner, belonging to my section, lay
about five yards from me, and nearer the enemy. I
asked him if he was hit, but got no reply. I tried to
raise myself, but felt a severe pain across the small of
my back. My first thought was that I had been hit
there, and I put my hand round, but could discover no
indication of a wound. I then dragged myself forward
towards Joyner, but when I got alongside him I saw
that he was dying and quite beyond human aid. I decided
the best thing to do was to get hold of my rifle,
which was lying about seven yards to my rear.</p>

<p>Having secured the rifle, I banked up some sand with
my hands and made a small sangar, behind which I took
up my position. All this time heavy firing was going
on, and bullets were continually dropping in the sand
all around me. Our men had now got a Maxim in position
immediately behind where I was lying, and there
seemed to be a duel going on over my head between it
and one of the enemy's machine-guns.</p>

<p>The Germans were very well concealed, and I could
see little to shoot at, but I had an occasional "pot" at
anything I thought was moving on the kopje. I afterwards
found out that there were about two hundred
Germans, some of whom were on the top of the sand-dune,
which was only two hundred and fifty yards away.
Some of the enemy must have seen me from their position,
for presently I got a bullet right through my hat,
which made me sit pretty tight. Needless to say I
promptly removed the injured headgear and put it beside
me.</p>

<p>The firing continued for nearly three hours, during
which time I did not know what was happening, as I
could not see our men. I then heard a loud cheer from
the direction of the enemy's trenches, and soon afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the fire seemed to die away, and I could distinctly
hear voices in front. Next I saw five men galloping
towards me from my right flank. At first I thought they
were my own men, but as they came closer I discovered
they were the enemy. I then realized, for the first time,
that our fellows had retired, and that I was surrounded.</p>

<p>I lay where I was until the Germans came up to me,
and they proceeded to disarm me by taking away my
rifle, bayonet, and bandoleer, which they examined carefully
for dum-dum bullets. They also took my haversack,
which contained my rations, and my field-glasses.
Two of them then assisted me towards the station, where
I found a large number of the enemy off-saddled. These
men were reinforcements from Aus, and it was their
arrival that had caused our force to retire. They numbered
about a thousand, with two Maxim guns. As I
approached the station a German officer came riding
past. He pulled up his horse and frowned at me. "You
are Imperial Light Horse, D Squadron," he growled.
"You were at Kolmaaskop. You &mdash;&mdash; dog!" Then he
rode on.</p>


<p>II&mdash;ON A PRISON TRAIN IN SOUTH AFRICA</p>

<p>I was now taken to a room at the back of the station,
where there were a number of German officers and a
German doctor sitting around smoking and laughing,
apparently well pleased at having driven the British
back. The doctor examined my back, and told me I
was not seriously hurt, but that the muscles were
strained. I remained in this room, under a guard, for
several hours. All this time the enemy appeared to be
blowing up the railway in the direction of Tchukaib, as
I could hear the explosions. Presently one of the German
officers came in and gave me some bread and water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
He could speak English, and was apparently seeking
information, as he asked me how many men had come to
Garub that morning, which question I refused to answer.
After several further attempts to get information about
our troops, and finding it useless, he left me. Towards
evening I was taken from the station to a train which
had arrived from Aus. On the way I was jeered at by
several German soldiers. One, I remember, asked,
"Well, how do you like the German-West, old chappie?"
When I arrived at the train I found that I was not the
only prisoner, as there was a Carabinier standing there
under escort. Immediately I saw him I beckoned him
to one side and told him, as I was an older soldier than
he, that either that evening or the following morning
we should be taken in front of the German intelligence
officer, and that he was to be very careful what he said.
This Carabinier was Trooper Martins, who was sent
with a despatch to General McKenzie from his officer
commanding. When within about two hundred yards
of the kopje where he expected to find the general the
enemy opened fire on him. He turned and galloped off,
but his horse was shot before he had gone far, and he
was unable to get away. Some Germans came down and
took him up to their trenches. This man and I were
close companions right up to the night of my escape.</p>

<p>We were now placed in a truck which contained two
horses and a native, and two armed guards got in with
us. After waiting for a couple of hours the train proceeded
to Aus, where we arrived after dark. Here we
were marched straight to the German guardroom. The
guards placed us in a dark cell, measuring about ten feet
by five, with a wooden bench to sleep on. The cell had
small portholes for windows, and a heavy door, which
was locked and barred. A sentry remained on guard
all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning one of the guards brought us some
breakfast, which consisted of black coffee without sugar,
some black bread, and a little fat. After we had eaten
this food we were taken from the cell, and brought to
a building where there seemed to be much military activity.
My mate was taken inside a room, and I was
sent away to the rear of the place with my guard. While
I was waiting several German soldiers came out, and
some of them asked me various questions.</p>

<p>After waiting for about an hour and a half the Carabinier
was brought out, and I was taken inside. Here
I found a German officer who could speak most perfect
English. He sat with large rolls of paper in front of
him, and started off by asking me my name, where I had
come from, what my nationality was, my religion, and
how long I had been in South Africa. I then told him
that I had no objection to answering questions concerning
myself or my people, but he must not ask me anything
about the force I belonged to. He then reminded
me curtly that I was a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>am</i> a prisoner of war," I said, "and I expect
to be treated as such." I added that, a short time previously,
I had been one of a party who captured some
Germans, including an officer, and I did not think our
O.C. brought any undue pressure to bear on them. This
seemed to cool the German down a bit, and he actually
started to give <i>me</i> information&mdash;of a sort. He asked me
if I knew that there were twenty-five thousand rebels
in the Orange Free State under De Wet and Beyers, also
if I was aware there was a rebellion in Egypt and India,
and that numbers of our Dreadnoughts had been sunk by
the German fleet? Fortunately I knew that all this was
false, so I was not dispirited. He next proceeded to ask
me questions concerning the forces, which, of course, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
refused to answer. Finally, with my mate, I was sent
back to the cell.</p>

<p>Here we were given some food, which consisted of
boiled meat and greasy water, intended for soup. When
we asked for knives and forks the guard said we could
not have any, "as there was a danger sometimes of prisoners
committing suicide." I happened to have a pen-knife,
which I had managed to conceal from my guards
the previous day when asked to turn out my pockets, and
so we managed somehow.</p>

<p>My mate told me that he had been given to understand
that if he would go back to his regiment and try to induce
the Boers to go over to the Germans he could have his
freedom. This he refused to do.</p>

<p>The morning following, after breakfast, we were
allowed to use water to wash ourselves. Later on in
the day we were taken separately in front of the German
commandant at Aus, and questioned once more. I informed
the commandant through the officer interpreter
that I had nothing to add to what I had said the previous
day. After several vain attempts to obtain information
we were sent back to our cell, where we remained until
the following day, when we were taken by a guard and
put on the train in a cattle-truck going east.</p>

<p>All the way along the line, wherever the train stopped,
German soldiers and women came and stared in at us.
One soldier remarked amiably that it would have been
better for us if we had been drowned before landing in
that country.</p>

<p>We arrived at Keetmanshoop at about 9 p.m., and
were met by a fresh guard, who took us to a military
barracks. Here we were given some food and blankets,
and obliged to sleep in a little room with a light burning
all night. A German officer visited us through the night.
During the time we were in Keetmanshoop several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the soldiers became very friendly, and some of them
were inclined to talk a lot. From one of them we learnt
what I considered to be very important information, of
most vital interest to our forces, and that night I could
not sleep, puzzling my brains as to the best way of
getting this news to them. The following morning I
suggested to my mate that if they made him the same
offer as they did at Aus he had better accept it, so that
he could carry this information. I also told him to tell
the Germans they could hold me responsible for any
breach of faith on his part. The offer, however, was
not renewed. We remained at Keetmanshoop until
December 24th, and were then taken under a strong
guard to the railway station, and placed in the train
going north.</p>

<p>While here we were joined by five other prisoners, one
of whom had been in a hospital suffering from a wound.
The other four were Dutchmen living in German South-West
who had been arrested because they refused to
fight for the Germans.</p>

<p>We arrived at Marintal about sundown, and here the
train remained for the night. We were allowed to get
out of the carriages and sleep on the ground, alongside
the railway line. The following morning one of our
guards "stood" us coffee in the hotel, as it was Christmas
morning&mdash;a decidedly merry Christmas for us!</p>


<p>III&mdash;BEHIND THE BARS IN WINDHUK PRISON</p>

<p>Finally, after a tedious journey, we reached Windhuk,
where we were taken straight to the jail, and all seven
of us placed in a small cell. Immediately after entering
it we heard voices calling us in English from surrounding
cells, and, looking through the bars of the windows,
we saw many anxious faces. All the men were shouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to us to know where we came from, what regiment we
belonged to, and if we could give them any news how the
war was going.</p>

<p>During our stay in Windhuk prison we were rather
badly treated, not being allowed out of the cell for more
than ten or fifteen minutes, morning and evening, and
never allowed to communicate with the other prisoners.
On the sly, when the warders were not watching us, we
sometimes managed to get a few words with them
through the windows, but that was all.</p>

<p>About a day or two after Christmas, while I was
looking through the bars of my cell window into the jail
yard, one of the political prisoners&mdash;a British subject
taken in German South-West after the war broke out&mdash;whispered
to me that there was great excitement amongst
the Germans down town owing to the receipt of news
that a British force had landed at Walfish Bay and had
occupied Swakopmund. I might here explain that the
political prisoner referred to enjoyed the privilege of
going down town under escort for the purpose of making
purchases for those prisoners who were fortunate
enough to have money or banking accounts. His information
was very useful to me, as this was how I first
discovered our forces were at the northern German seaport.</p>

<p>The prison food here was very bad. It consisted of
a quarter-loaf of bread (to last all day), a cup of black
coffee in the morning, without sugar, and the same in the
evening. At midday we got an enamel basin with some
dirty-looking meat and mealie soup, and sometimes a
little rice or macaroni. We were given to understand
that this was the same food as the Kafir convicts got.
There were from thirty to forty Britishers in the prison,
mostly "politicals"&mdash;British subjects taken in German
South-West Africa after the war broke out, the balance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
being soldiers belonging principally to the Union Defence
Force. There was also in this prison a captain of
the Royal Fusiliers named Limfrey, who had been on
a shooting trip in the country, and who was arrested by
the Germans as a spy. Not being able to prove anything
against him, however, they kept him as a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>On January 8th we were taken from the prison with
fourteen other prisoners, making seventeeen in all (the
four Dutchmen being left behind), and marched through
Windhuk to another prison at the military barracks,
where we remained for the night. The following morning
we were given some kit, consisting of a shirt, blanket,
mess tin, knife, fork, spoon, and towel, and then
taken to the railway station, where there were a large
number of people congregated to look at us.</p>

<p>From Windhuk we went to Karabib and Okanyande,
and were then told to prepare for yet another journey.</p>

<p>On the day following&mdash;January 16th&mdash;all the soldier
prisoners, forty-seven in all, including six officers, left
in four ox-wagons for Franzfontein. We travelled by
night, and slept by day. Water was very scarce <i>en route</i>,
and was obtainable only from boreholes on the farms,
which were few and far between.</p>

<p>The escort consisted of German soldiers on each
wagon; also a mounted party under the charge of an
officer.</p>

<p>We arrived at Outju, a large and important military
post, on January 19th. Here we found nearly all of the
officers of the Union Forces who were prisoners. We
remained for a couple of hours, and I had the opportunity
of speaking to several of them, and amongst them
Captain Turner Jones. With him I discussed the possibility
of the information which I had gleaned at Keetmanshoop
being conveyed to our forces, but he told me
that he did not think there was the least chance of anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
getting away. However, I gave him the information
in case anybody managed it. We then proceeded
on our journey, having left the six officers behind and
taken up three men.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;UNDER A GUARD OF HOTTENTOTS</p>

<p>We arrived at our destination on the morning of the
24th. Franzfontein is a military post of some importance,
in direct telegraphic and telephonic communication
with Windhuk and about a hundred and fifty miles from
the railway. On arrival here we were told off in messes
of ten, one man being in charge of each mess. We were
then marched into the barbed-wire enclosure, where we
found two hundred and ninety-three other prisoners.
They had all been there for about four months, and represented
eighteen different regiments.</p>

<p>The first thing we did on arrival in the camp was to
rig up a "bivvy" for shelter from the blazing sun, and
to sleep in at night. This was done by fastening a blanket
and waterproof sheet together, and with two sticks,
and stones for anchors, we made a little tent large
enough for two people. Cadman, of the S.A. Mounted
Rifles, and myself were the inmates of our particular
"bivvy." Martins and Lawford, our other mates, slept
under a tree alongside. We then fixed up a fireplace.
Most of the men had already built little ovens, so we
were soon as comfortable as circumstances would permit.</p>

<p>The enclosure was of a triangular shape, about a quarter-acre
in extent, and had a stream of water running
right through from fence to fence. Outside the barbed
wire there was a thick thorn-bush hedge built up to form
a sort of stockade. We were obliged to parade each
morning at 6 a.m., afternoon at four, and every evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
at six, when the man in charge of each mess reported
if his ten men were on parade. This report was conveyed
through the sergeant-major to the German officer
who was always present. Rations were drawn each
morning by the men in charge of every mess. The only
amusement in camp was bathing in a pool which the
prisoners had constructed by widening the stream, with
an occasional open-air concert at night-time, which always
concluded with the National Anthem and "Rule
Britannia," everyone present standing to attention. At
the base of the triangle was the guard-house, which was
fitted with a large alarm-bell. Two soldiers were always
on sentry outside the triangle, night and day.</p>

<p>The garrison consisted of twenty-five to thirty soldiers,
and a number of Hottentots. The Germans were
also reputed to have several bloodhounds, and special
native trackers. I also heard that they had a Maxim
gun in the barracks.</p>

<p>From the time we left Keetmanshoop until we arrived
at Franzfontein my sole thought was the best way of
escape, and I discussed this matter with several men on
the journey. My first idea was to go north towards
Portuguese territory, through Ovamboland; but I found
I should have to travel through a fever-stricken country
inhabited by hostile natives. Immediately on my arrival
at Franzfontein, one of the first things I noticed&mdash;which
appeared to me to be rather extraordinary&mdash;was
that most of the men appeared to be in possession of
water-bottles. I could not understand why the Germans
had not taken these away.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival in camp I received a message
from Dr. Dawson&mdash;a prisoner who acted as medical
officer to the prisoners&mdash;stating that he would like to see
me. I found him in a rather dilapidated house close to
the base of the triangle. He told me that he had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that I had been caught on the Luderitzbucht side recently,
and wanted to know all the recent news.</p>

<p>After having talked with him for some time, I came
to the conclusion that I was speaking to a man who
could be a good friend, and whom I could trust, so I
asked him what he thought of the chances of escaping.
He told me that several men had been discussing it, but
he was afraid it was hopeless, as he considered it a
physical impossibility for anyone to carry sufficient water
to maintain a human being during the time it would take
to reach Swakopmund, the nearest point occupied by our
forces.</p>

<p>Life in the camp during the next few days was very
monotonous, and food appeared to be daily getting
scarcer. They gave us flour, which we mixed
with our mealie meal porridge to make it "pan out," as
we found making bread not at all economical. Sometimes
the meat was very bad, and once or twice the doctor
ordered us not to eat it. We received firewood every
evening, and of this there was no scarcity, on account of
the surrounding country being composed of thick bush.</p>

<p>All the time the problem of escape worried me.</p>


<p>V&mdash;THE NIGHT ESCAPE IN THE STORM</p>

<p>On February 3rd, about 2 p.m., I met Dunbar, of the
Transvaal Horse Artillery, and asked him if he could
introduce me to any man in camp who knew the road to
Swakopmund. He told me that nobody had ever been in
that part of the country before, so that no one knew the
road. About an hour later he informed me the doctor
wished to speak to me. On entering the room where Dr.
Dawson was, he told me to close the door and sit down.
Looking out of the window, to make sure that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
were no German soldiers about, he said, "I am informed
that you are anxious to escape. Why is that?"</p>

<p>I told him I possessed what I considered to be valuable
military information, which I was anxious to communicate
to the authorities. He then asked me if I had
thought of the difficulty of reaching Swakopmund across
something like two hundred and fifty miles of mountainous
desert country. I replied that I had seen a map, had
a fair idea of the distance, and was prepared to take
my chance. Dr. Dawson next inquired if I thought I
was strong enough to stand the journey, as it could not
possibly be done in less than seven days, and anyone
attempting the task would have to carry at least four
water-bottles and two water-bags.</p>

<p>"If you are going to escape," he added, "it must be
to-night, between eight and nine o'clock. There are three
other men going at that time, and you can join them."</p>

<p>He inquired what preparations I had made with regard
to food and water on the road, and I told him none.</p>

<p>"I can supply flour to make fat cookies," he said, "but
you will have to see to the water-bottles and water-bags
yourself."</p>

<p>Then, in confidence, I told the doctor what I had
heard at Keetmanshoop, and he agreed with me that the
news was most important, and that I must go at all costs.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the doctor sent for the other men
who were to be my companions in the attempt to escape.
They were Sergeant Mackenzie, of the Upington commando,
a Scotchman; Trooper Maritz, of the South
African Mounted Rifles, a Boer; and Trooper Franzen,
of the Veteran Signalling Corps, a Norwegian. When
they entered the room he formally introduced me to
them, and told them that I wanted to accompany them on
the journey. After having discussed our plans for getting
away from the camp, and the route we were to take,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
we parted, having arranged to meet again at 8.30 p.m.
under a specified tree close to the fence. Needless to
say, I was very excited, but I started to collect water-bottles
and bags, and by 7 p.m. had everything prepared
for the journey. One of my messmates, Trooper Cadman,
kindly gave me his boots, as he thought they were
in better condition than my own for our long desert trek.
Another, Trooper Martins, gave me his socks, water-bottle,
and water-bags. Trooper Lawford gave me his
haversack and tunic. The tunic I was not inclined to
accept, as it was the only one he had, but the generous
fellow pressed me to take it. Trooper Dunbar, of the
Transvaal Horse Artillery, gave me his belt, containing
a pair of wirecutters, which he had concealed from the
Germans. These were the only cutters in the camp, all
others being taken away.</p>

<p>At about 8 p.m. I said good-bye to my own messmates,
all of whom wished me the best of luck, and requested
me to communicate with their relatives if I was fortunate
enough to get through.</p>

<p>I then made my way to the appointed spot, where I
met the other three men, also the doctor and a few of our
comrades who were "in the know." Here I received fifteen
or sixteen "fat cookies," which I placed in my
haversack, together with a half-bottle of rum. The doctor
had previously given us a small compass, and each
of us had a "first field dressing" in case of wounds, also
some boracic powder and a tin of ointment, which we
found very useful on the journey.</p>

<p>And now came the business of the escape. One man was
placed at the point of the triangle, as shown in the sketch,
and another at the base, to signal to us when all was
clear. The signal arranged was the striking of matches.
All four of us, after having shaken hands with our benefactor,
the doctor, crept down alongside the fence. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
was very dark, and there was a slight drizzle of rain.
The other prisoners in camp were attending a concert
which had been arranged by the doctor to avert suspicion.
As we lay there, waiting breathlessly for the signal, we
could hear the two German sentries talking outside the
fence, only some ten yards away from where we lay. We
had to remain motionless for about half an hour, and
needless to say the suspense was very great. At last,
however, the sentries moved, going in opposite directions
around the triangle, and soon afterwards we saw the
eagerly-awaited signal. Franzen, one of my three companions,
immediately got out underneath the wire and
through the bush on the outside. The dogs at the farmhouse
about a hundred yards away promptly commenced
to bark, and we had to remain where we were for about
ten minutes, dreading discovery all the time. Maritz,
another of my companions, then followed Franzen; Mackenzie
went next, and I followed. Getting underneath
the fence was a rather difficult task, as we had to lie flat
on our bodies and drag ourselves through, each hand
being fully occupied holding a water-bag. When I got
outside the fence I rearranged the bushes to cover the
gap we had made, and then made tracks in the direction
of a large tree some fifty yards from the fence, going
from here to an old kraal wall where we had arranged
to meet. On arrival there, I found that I had lost one of
my precious water-bottles and the half-bottle of rum in
getting through the fence, but we decided we must go on
without them.</p>

<p>"Well, this is the first part of the business finished,"
said someone, and then, shaking hands, we set out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>


<p>VI&mdash;FLEEING ACROSS THE AFRICAN WILDS</p>

<p>We travelled all night over flat country covered with
thick thorn-bush, going in a south-westerly direction until
6 a.m. the following morning, when we rested for an
hour. Then we pushed on again; we wished to put as
great a distance as possible between us and the camp, as
we thought there was a danger of the Germans finding
the missing water-bottles and the half-bottle of rum at
daylight. Even if they did, however, we knew the native
trackers would have a difficulty in picking up our
"spoor," as it had been raining during the night, and the
rain would have obliterated our footprints.</p>

<p>About noon we saw a herd of whitish animals, like
mules, which I understood were quagga. We also saw
several herds of zebra. We halted again at 1 p.m., rested
for another hour, and then walked on until 9 p.m. The
country here was hilly, with patches of thorn-bush, and
the veldt offered fair going. We rested until 11 p.m.,
walked on until three next morning (February 5th) and
rested until five. From 5 a.m. we walked all day over
sandy, flat country covered with thick bush. Here I got
separated from the others for about two hours, but was
in no danger, as I carried the compass at this time. I
afterwards saw my companions about a mile away, and
we exchanged signals and soon came together again. I
then handed the compass back to Franzen, and between
him and Mackenzie it was carried for the remainder of
the journey.</p>

<p>About 7 p.m. we got some water to drink from crevices
in the rocks, by sucking it up. It was a laborious business,
but we wanted to conserve our scanty supply as
much as possible. This was about 9 p.m. Soon after
dark it commenced to rain very hard, and we got wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
through, having no shelter and all being in shirt-sleeves
(I had discarded the tunic given me by Trooper Lawford
and buried it in the sand the previous day). We moved
on again at midnight, but were only able to proceed slowly
as it was still pitch dark, and the ground very rocky.
However, we struggled along until 4 a.m.</p>

<p>We started off again at daybreak, feeling frightfully
cold and miserable, our clothes being soaked through.
We managed to fill four water-bags from pools in the
rocks, crossed a sand flat, and halted about noon at a
small kopje in the middle of it. While resting there we
saw a Klip Kafir coming from a north-westerly direction.
He passed without seeing us, and returned at about
3 p.m. with a companion. We had to remain hidden until
5 p.m., owing to the proximity of these natives, as they
would have been dangerous to us. They are quite uncivilized
and wild, use poisoned arrows, and are generally
shot by the Germans at sight. They had four dogs
with them, and we were lucky the animals did not scent
us.</p>

<p>We were obliged to sit tight for some time after these
savages passed, as they disappeared down an old riverbed,
and we were not sure whether they had remained
there watching us or not. However, luckily for us, it
was the last we saw of them, so at about 5 p.m. we resumed
our journey, and continued walking until 7 a.m.
the following morning (Saturday, February 6th). During
the night we suddenly came upon a few native huts
at the bottom of a cliff, close to an old riverbed, but we
passed as quickly as possible and none of the inmates
appeared to have heard us. Probably these huts belonged
to the natives we had seen earlier in the day.</p>

<p>We had now arrived at the "Blue Mountains," which
we could see so plainly from our prison camp at Franzfontein.
We were obliged to keep to the north of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
range, as we looked upon it as being one of our "danger-points."
We had heard that the enemy had a signalling-post
on the highest peak, which communicated with
Omarura. Since then I have been informed that they
not only had a signalling-post, but a whole company stationed
on top of these mountains, so our luck was again
in.</p>

<p>Having rested from 7 to 11 a.m. we moved on once
more. The country now became very broken and hard
to walk over. Deep kloofs and huge boulders were
much in evidence, and we had to do a lot of climbing.
To make matters worse, my boots were giving way fast,
and had it not been for the wirecutters given to me by
Dunbar, I don't know what I should have done, as with
them I managed to pull out the nails and repair the boots
with a piece of wire I had in my pocket. My feet were
now getting very sore, and the climbing began to tell,
for each hill seemed to be steeper and higher than the
previous one, and the ground got steadily worse and
worse.</p>

<p>About 2 p.m. we suddenly came on some running
water, which gave us great encouragement, as we thought
it was the Omarura River, and we rested here for an
hour. Our "fat cookies" were now running low, and we
only dared eat half of one for each meal, when we could
easily have demolished six or seven and still felt hungry.
At 3 p.m. we resumed our journey for about two hours,
but as we found the stream was bearing too much to the
north-west we reluctantly decided to leave it. Filling
up our water-bottles and sacks, and taking a good drink,
we again struck off in a south-westerly course across a
high mountain. The stream we had just left might only
exist for a day, being caused by the recent rains in the
mountains. It was the first running water I saw in German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
South-West, with the exception of the small stream
at Franzfontein.</p>

<p>We continued walking until 7 p.m. and then waited
for the moon to rise.</p>

<p>It made its appearance at 11 p.m. and we again resumed
our wearisome tramp and continued marching
until 5 a.m., passing through a broken, hilly region. We
rested for about half an hour, and then "trekked" on
once more, continuing the whole day until 6 p.m. over
frightful country. I thought we should never come to
the end of these terrible mountains, and my poor feet
were not improving. We rested from 6 till 10 p.m. and
moved on again till 1 a.m., when we halted for three
hours, all of us feeling very tired and exhausted. This
was Tuesday, February 9th. We started again at 4
a.m., got out of the hills about 7 a.m., and continued
walking over fairly flat country until 11 a.m., when we
were obliged to halt and rest, as the heat was unbearable.
At 3 p.m. we "trekked" on. Our troubles seemed
to be on the increase, for presently my boots gave out
altogether. One of my comrades, Maritz, manufactured
a pair of sandals for himself from my leggings, using his
sheath knife, and gave me his own <i>veldt schoons</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. His
feet were in good hard condition, as he had been going
without boots for some considerable time. The <i>veldt
schoons</i> he made himself whilst a prisoner, from raw hide,
and I found them very useful, although a little on the
small side. I was obliged to cut a piece off the toe of each,
which afterwards handicapped me, as the sand worked
in and made blisters on my feet. I used the pugaree
from my hat and the bandages from my "first field dressing"
to prevent this, but with very little benefit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>
<p>We continued walking until 9 a.m., when we halted for
two hours. Our food was now running out. I had one
"fat cookie" and Mackenzie had a half of one. I shared
mine between Franzen, Maritz, and myself. The two
men at first seemed reluctant to accept their portion, but
I insisted on it, saying that we might just as well all die
together. At 11 p.m. we again resumed our interminable
journey, and walked on till 3 a.m., when we rested for
one hour, and continued until daybreak. We could now
distinctly hear the roar of the sea, and also see the fog
along the coast. This gave us great encouragement, and
we went ahead with renewed energy. About 10.30 a.m.
we struck some wheel-tracks leading south-west, which
we decided to follow. This was Wednesday, February
10th.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;LEFT BEHIND TO DIE IN THE DESERT</p>

<p>I now found it very difficult to keep up with the others,
owing to my feet being so bad. The heat was terrific,
and, to make matters worse, our precious water was
almost finished. Early in the afternoon I found that I
was unable to continue at the same pace as the rest, so
I told them to go on. I would follow as best I could,
I said, and if they reached Swakopmund they could send
back assistance. My own idea was that it was better
for one man to die than all four, as the others could not
be of any assistance to me by remaining. As they moved
on Franzen waved a cheery good-bye. "We will wait
for you at Swakopmund," he shouted. I now took off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
my <i>veldt schoons</i> to attend to my blistered feet, and remained
for a few hours resting until it got a bit cooler.
I divested myself of all superfluous articles, left two of
my water-bottles and the wirecutters behind, and walked
on alone. By this time I could distinctly see the waves
beating upon the shore and soon afterwards reached the
beach, where I followed the coastline south.</p>

<p>Towards evening I sighted some buildings, which I
thought were the outskirts of Swakopmund. This gave
me great encouragement, so I continued as fast as circumstances
would permit, and reached the buildings after
dark. To my disappointment I found only several broken-down
shanties, without any signs of life. I afterwards
discovered that this was a sealing station, and the name
of the spot Cape Cross. The buildings had been destroyed
by the Germans, and the people who worked
there, being mostly British, were taken prisoners. Cape
Cross is ninety miles from Swakopmund, and had I
known this fact then I should probably have thrown up
the sponge. My only thoughts at the time were of our
own pickets, whom I feared might shoot me. Several
times I fancied I heard the challenge, "Halt! Who goes
there?" to which I replied "Friend!" in a loud voice;
but each time the only answer I received was the mocking
echo of my own voice. Presently I noticed a tramline,
which I followed for a mile or two, when suddenly
I heard a peculiar noise, resembling pigs grunting and
lambs bleating. I went in the direction of these animals,
as I supposed, and suddenly found myself right in the
thick of a herd of seals, some of them much bigger
than myself, who started jumping all around me. I
"cleared" for all I was worth, as I had nothing to protect
myself with. This must have been about 11 p.m.,
and soon afterwards it began to rain heavily, so I dug
a hole behind a mound to protect myself from the piercing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
wind. It was bitterly cold, and I was soaked to the
skin in a very short space of time. My bags were empty,
and here were tons of life-giving water going to waste,
so I devised a plan to catch some of the precious liquid,
by cutting the side and top seams of my water-bags,
spreading them out on the sand, and then making an
impression in the centre which formed a cup-shape.
When the rain ceased I got out of my burrow, and had
a good drink of the water which my sack had caught.
This was the last fresh water I had until the following
Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Feeling miserably cold and weak, I moved stiffly on
through the darkness. At daybreak, to my concern, I
found that I was nearly surrounded by the sea, but the
water on my left was not very deep. Here I saw thousands
of pelicans and other birds, so I looked for eggs,
but could not find any. Taking off my <i>schoons</i>, socks,
and riding pants, I waded across the water to dry land.
Here I noticed a few wagon tracks going north and
south, so I decided to follow them, wherever they led.
After wandering along for some hours I saw some rocky
ground on my left and went towards it in search of fresh
water. I found a little in the crevices in the rocks, but
unfortunately it was brackish. However, I filled my remaining
water-bottles, as it was better than nothing, and
continued on my journey along the sea coast until the
heat became unbearable. I then halted and took off my
shirt, and with the assistance of some large whale-bones,
with which the beach was strewn, and the remains of an
old deck-chair which had been washed up on the shore,
I rigged up a shade and remained under it until it got
cool, when I again moved on. This time I walked until
it got quite dark, when I dug a hole in the sand behind
a mound and got into it. By this time my hopes of reaching
Swakopmund had almost completely vanished, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
I wondered if I should ever wake again. I felt quite
indifferent to my fate; in fact, as I scooped out the hole,
the thought occurred to me that I was digging my own
grave. After getting into it I saw two wolves, or wild
dogs&mdash;I don't know which&mdash;but they only looked at me
and trotted off. If they had attacked me I should have
fallen an easy victim.</p>

<p>I slept well that night, and did not awake until daybreak,
when I again got on the move. Several times
during the day I must have been quite delirious, for
once I found myself sitting on a rock cleaning out the
salty sand from a hole, so that when it rained again the
water there would not be salty, and some poor traveller
might get a drink! About noon I crossed a riverbed, and
found some more water, which was also brackish. Later
on I crossed yet another channel, which, I understand,
was the Amuroro River. There was a little vegetation
here, but no water. However, I found a large wild-fig tree
laden with green figs, so I thought I was in clover; but
to my dismay found the inside of them perfectly dry,
and full of insects. I did manage to eat some of the
outside peel; then I lay down under the tree and slept
for a couple of hours. When I awoke I found four
arrows quite close to me, and tied them together with a
piece of calico. Looking around the tree, I found four
more. They were all cleverly made, with feathers at
the end, and I took them with me and moved on.</p>

<p>I have no recollection of what happened during the
night of that day, but I must have been wandering on
all the time. The following day I saw a mountain away
on my left, so I thought of going towards it, as there
might be a chance of getting water. I went about a
mile, but finally decided it was no good going any farther.
I then commenced turning up all the stones I could find,
so that if it rained I might catch a little water to drink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
The fluid in my bottles was now getting putrid. I had
been taking a mouthful at a time, not allowing any to
get down my throat, as I feared that if I swallowed the
awful stuff it would drive me mad. I was now asking
myself which was the best and easiest way of putting an
end to my misery; I had no hope of getting out alive.</p>

<p>I believe if it had not been for the valuable information
which I possessed, and which first prompted me to
attempt to escape, I should have committed suicide, but
a reluctance to let my news die with me kept me going.
I now seemed to be having recurrent spasms of delirium,
for once I remember suddenly coming to my senses and
finding I was laughing. I imagined then my end was
pretty near. It did not seem to worry me; in fact, I
felt a sort of happy feeling, and thought to myself,
"Well, I am going to meet my old friends who are dead."</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;DIGGING MY OWN GRAVE&mdash;THE
REUNION</p>

<p>I tied my water-sack to a piece of the deck-chair which
I had been using for a walking-stick, to represent a flag,
and propped it up in the hope that it might be seen by
some passing ship or a patrol. It would also mark the
place where my body would be found. I then lay down
and went to sleep for a couple of hours. Soon after I
awoke I noticed three figures walking along the beach,
about half a mile from me. I stood up and signalled
to them, and they stopped, looked towards me, and then
moved on.</p>

<p>"Whoever you are," I thought, "I am going to follow
you." So I picked up my flag, arrows, and water-bottles&mdash;I
must have looked a regular Robinson Crusoe&mdash;and
went towards them. They sat down and waited for me.
When I got up to them I thought they were natives, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
they appeared to be black, and it was only after Mackenzie
spoke that I recognized his voice, and knew that they
were my own mates, whom I had lost three days previously.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Pat!" cried Mackenzie. "How have
you lived? Where did you get water?"</p>

<p>By way of reply I handed him my water-bottles. He
took the cork out of one, smelt it, and threw both away;
they smelt horrible. He then gave me some water, and
I may say that I never tasted anything so sweet in my
life before. I only took a little at a time, but each
mouthful seemed to give me fresh life, and my tongue,
which was swollen, got back to its normal size, and the
horrid dry feeling in my throat went away. We remained
here about an hour, during which time my mates
and I compared notes as to what had happened since
we parted on the Wednesday.</p>

<p>It was now February 13th, and a Saturday afternoon.
They told me that on arrival at the sealing station, the
evening we separated, they turned into a house and fixed
up a lamp with some seal oil which they found. They
left the lamp burning at the window so that I could see
it, and being very tired, all of them went to sleep. The
lamp, however, must have gone out. In the morning,
finding that I had not turned up, Franzen and Maritz
went back to see if they could find me. In the meantime
Mackenzie hunted for shellfish among the rocks,
and managed to find enough for two meals. There was
a plentiful supply of water, as the previous night's rain
had half-filled several old tanks. After going back a
few miles Maritz and Franzen found the lid of a small
tin box which they knew I had been carrying in my
haversack. From this they realized that I had passed
their sleeping-place during the night, and was probably
somewhere in front. To make quite sure, however, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
waited all that day, and resumed the journey on Friday
morning. They noticed my "spoor," but had lost it
some hours previously.</p>

<p>Mackenzie advised me to throw away the arrows I had
been carrying, as one of us might easily get scratched and
poisoned with them. I was now feeling much refreshed,
so we all "trekked" on together. We had not gone very
far when we saw a white sea-bird, with red on its bill,
standing on the sand. It looked sick, so we gathered
round it, and I gave Maritz my piece of deck-chair to
kill it with.</p>

<p>We then set about collecting firewood, there being any
amount of driftwood scattered about the beach, and with
the aid of flint and steel, which Mackenzie carried with
him, we lit a great blazing fire. In the meantime Maritz
had skinned the bird, and Franzen had got some salt
water in a kettle they had picked up at Cape Cross.
After boiling our bird for about fifteen minutes we
tackled it, my share being the liver and one of the legs.
It did not taste at all bad. We then sat by the fire for
some little time, feeling a good deal better, and again
resumed our journey. We walked until 3 a.m., and
then tried to sleep, but found it too cold. At daybreak
we resumed our tramp. It began to drizzle, and about
nine o'clock we came to some flat, rocky ground, where
I borrowed a water-bottle from Franzen, and managed
to fill it. We walked on until about 3 p.m., when we
sighted what appeared to be tall chimney-stacks in the
distance. Franzen asked me what I thought they were,
and I said, "Perhaps some abandoned place, like the one
we passed up the coast."</p>

<p>"I think it's Swakopmund," he said.</p>

<p>This I ridiculed, for I had quite given up hopes of
seeing the town. I was feeling very weak now, and my
feet were frightfully sore on account of the sand getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
through my <i>schoons</i>. The others decided to push on as
fast as possible, and, if the place turned out to be Swakopmund,
to send back help. Before long they were out
of sight, and I was alone once more. However, I
"trekked" on, and just as the sun was going down I
saw, to my huge delight, smoke emerging from a chimney-stack.
I knew then that it must be the place we
were looking for, and this made me plod on with fresh
energy.</p>


<p>IX&mdash;SAVED AND READY FOR THE
FRAY AGAIN</p>

<p>When I was about a mile and a half from the smoking
chimney I saw three men coming towards me leading a
horse. I signalled to them, and sat down to await their
arrival. They turned out to be men of my own regiment,
attached to the police of Swakopmund. They had
been ordered out to meet me, my mates having reported
that I was following on behind them. I was put on the
horse, and on the way into Swakopmund was met by hundreds
of men of the garrison. Some brought brandy
and others tea, and one party had a stretcher. They let
me have a little brandy, and removed me from the horse
to the stretcher, and in this I was conveyed to the hospital.</p>

<p>The men of the garrison cheered again and again, and
all of them seemed greatly excited. I suppose our arrival
was something new for them, as I understand that
duty at Swakopmund had been very uneventful.</p>

<p>I was taken to the Antonios Hospital, which was under
the charge of Major Moffatt, and he and everybody else
was most kind and attentive. My pulse on arrival read
thirty-eight, and the nursing sister put me on the scales
the following day, when I found, to my great surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
that I had lost twenty-nine pounds in weight. Very
soon, however, I began to regain strength, and in a few
days could move around. After spending ten days in
hospital I was brought before a board of officers, who
inquired into the cause of my capture, and returned a
verdict "that I became a prisoner through the fortunes
of war, and through no fault of my own."</p>

<p>The same day I was sent to Walfish Bay, and the following
morning joined the S.S. <i>City of Athens</i> for Cape
Town, on a month's sick leave.</p>

<p>There were seven or eight Germans on board who had
been made prisoners. I was told that they refused to
believe that four men had escaped from Franzfontein
Camp. They said that such a thing was quite impossible.</p>

<p>I have since been informed on good authority that we
were almost recaptured within a few miles of Swakopmund.
Since the surrender of German South-West I
have ascertained from a released prisoner from Franzfontein
Camp that our escape was "given away" by one
of our fellow-prisoners just three days after we left.
The Germans promptly gave chase, and must have been
very close behind us at Cape Cross.</p>

<p>The Germans, however, returned and reported us dead,
and as proof of their statement they produced my hat,
which I had lost on the night of my encounter with the
seals, south of Cape Cross. Some of our men had little
difficulty in identifying the hat, as it was punctured by
a bullet in the action at Garub, and had an "I.L.H."
badge on it, which they knew by sight. When the officer
commanding the camp first heard of our escape he
laughed and said we could not get through, and that we
were mad to try it. We did pull through, however, by
the mercy of Providence, and are now again ready for
the fray.</p>

<p>In conclusion I would like to state that I am quite convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that, if they had had the chance, there were many
other men amongst the prisoners at Franzfontein who
would have accompanied our party. My own part in
escaping from the enemy and bringing what I believed
to be important information to our own forces I consider
was nothing more or less than my duty, and what nine
out of every ten soldiers would have done in similar
circumstances.</p>

<h2>WHAT AN AMERICAN WOMAN SAW
ON THE SERBIAN FRONT</h2>

<p class="center"><i>How I Viewed a Battle from a Precipice</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Mrs. Charles H. Farnum of New York</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Farnum was decorated by Prince Alexander for her
relief work in Serbia. Here she tells how she stood for six
hours at a military observation station on October 11, 1916, and
watched the successful fight of the Serbians to regain the village
of Brod at the beginning of their advance against the Bulgarians.
Her story is told in the <i>New York Sun</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF A DINNER WITH PRINCE
ALEXANDER</p>

<p>Having conducted hospital work with the Serbian
armies in two Balkan wars it was out of the question for
me to go anywhere but to Serbia when the present conflict
started. I love Serbia and the Serbian people, and
when I have told my story perhaps you will, too.</p>

<p>After serving through one campaign, a disastrous one
for Serbia, I came to America, and with the assistance of
Miss Catherine Burke raised $38,000 for the American
unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital. I was only too
eager to accept when it was suggested by the Serbian
Relief Committee that I return to the war zone to see
that the money was properly administered.</p>

<p>This explains how I came to be in Ostrova on a certain
evening last October, seated at dinner next to Prince
Alexander of Serbia, whose generosity of heart led him
to overestimate my service to his nation.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go to the front?" he asked me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>I had been behind the battle lines, and I wanted to
tell my countrymen just how the Serbs were fighting.</p>

<p>"I would like nothing better," I said, "but, of course,
it is impossible."</p>

<p>The Prince smiled. "Madam," he replied, "nothing
that you may wish is impossible."</p>

<p>I thought at first that it was merely his innate politeness,
but with the least possible delay Prince Alexander
delivered me into the care of Col. Sondermayer, chief of
the medical service of the Serbian army.</p>

<p>"She is to go wherever she wishes to," was the command
delivered to the Colonel.</p>

<p>And so we started out in a somewhat rattly automobile
and went upward into the mountains, passing a continuous
stream of soldiers&mdash;French going to Kisova and
Serbians to Dobrpolje. Ammunition trains and convoys
of wounded rumbled over the roads day and night. They
were the back currents, the eddies of the war we were
traversing.</p>

<p>As we passed a stone post at the side of the wheel-rutted
road one of the officers said: "We are now in
Serbia. This soil has been wrested from the conqueror."</p>

<p>I cried, "Stoy!" which is to say "Stop."</p>

<p>The chauffeur brought the car to a standstill and I
jumped out. The men followed me and we knelt and
kissed the soil we all loved. I do not think their emotion
could have been stronger than my own.</p>

<p>Shortly after this Major Todorovitch pointed into the
sky and said, "See the aeroplanes. They are our scouts."</p>

<p>I looked in the direction he indicated, but all I could
see was a series of puffs of white. It was shrapnel from
the Bulgarian guns bursting so close to the Serbian planes
that the round puffs of smoke were drawn out into
streaks by the suction of the fast flying machines.</p>

<p>Occasionally we could see the sun flash on the wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of the aeroplanes just as you can sometimes see the approach
of a canoe by the flash of the sunlight on the
paddles before you can really distinguish the craft itself.</p>

<p>At Vrbeni I met Gen. Vassitch, the "<i>voivode mishitch</i>"
(commander-in-chief) of all the Serbian forces. Col.
Sondermayer explained that I wished to go to the front.</p>

<p>"How far forward do you wish to go?" asked the
General.</p>

<p>"As far as your officers can go," I replied.</p>

<p>The General shrugged his shoulders as though to say,
"There is no place for these women in war," then seeming
suddenly to realize that I was in earnest, he bowed
and said, "Madam, you should have been one of us&mdash;one
of our Serbian soldiers."</p>

<p>Calling his aide-de-camp, Major Todorovitch, he directed
him to obey my orders and take me wherever I
wished to go, so we again got into the rattly automobile
and began to climb still further up into the mountains.</p>

<p>In the distance I heard the roar of the big guns. As
their noise grew louder the strumming of the machine
guns mingled with it and their staccato was always distinguishable
even amid the ear crushing thunder of the
high explosives. Then came the rat-a-pat of rifle fire,
foolishly insignificant in point of noise compared to the
cannon, but cruelly deadly, as any one who has seen war
knows.</p>

<p>Artillery is terrifying, but after all it is cold steel in
the hand-to-hand, bestial fighting that slays.</p>


<p>II&mdash;THE WOUNDED ON THE SERBIAN ROADS</p>

<p>The ammunition wagons almost jammed one side of
the road now and the other side was jammed with the
carts bringing back the wounded. On their scant beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of straw they lay, some groaning, some shrieking in delirium,
some grinning, but almost all of them contented
and uncomplaining if they had a cigarette.</p>

<p>Your wounded Serbian prefers his cigarette to an
anæsthetic, and I have seen the most painful, shocking
operations performed in the field hospitals with no other
sedative for the patient than a cigarette. In Serbia no
one begs. It is considered almost a crime, but there is
one temptation the soldiers cannot resist, especially the
wounded ones. That is to ask for a cigarette.</p>

<p>During one of our halts I spoke to one poor fellow
whose lips were blue, eyes dim and breath coming in
short, painful gasps, almost sobs. I knew that before
he reached the field hospital his body would be taken
from the cart and laid at the roadside for burial.</p>

<p>Although the words almost killed him he managed
to gasp, "Little Sister&mdash;for the love&mdash;of mercy&mdash;a cigarette."</p>

<p>I gave him one. I saw him take one blissful puff, blow
from his mouth the smoke, which was no bluer than his
lips, and die. So small a thing as a cigarette had sent
one man who died for his country before his God with
a smile upon his lips, despite his suffering. Was this not
worth my whole trip?</p>

<p>We passed the Serbian artillery and to the summit
of Dobrpolje. Here in the crevice of a great rock we
ate lunch, which had been supplied by officers at the very
front. There were pancakes, raw onions, bread and
Turkish coffee, and a meat stew. I know something about
fare at the front, and there is no doubt in my mind that
these same officers went on short rations for many a day
to make up for the repast they set me. There was more
sugar in the coffee than a soldier in Serbia gets in four
days.</p>

<p>In our crevice in the rock we were 500 yards in advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of the Serbian guns. The panorama of the battle
was spread out before us. The great projectiles from
the masked Serbian artillery, which was being fired over
a range of hills, swept diagonally in front of me from a
line behind. They exploded in the village of Brod and
on the hill in the rear of it were the Bulgarian trenches.
Through binoculars I could see into the Serbian trenches
and sometimes men in the Bulgarian trenches.</p>

<p>The enemy's guns were firing from behind the hill on
which stood the village of Brod, but they did not have
the range of our artillery, and most of their fire fell on
a village a quarter of a mile in our rear. At times, however,
a big shell exploded in the Serbian trenches and I
saw monstrous mushrooms of earth and debris hurled
high into the air.</p>

<p>In the debris were many fragments. Some were of
timber and some were of human flesh and bone.</p>

<p>Stretching away directly in front of us was a wide
plain, at the far extremity of which against a hill was
Monastir, resembling a great cluster of pearls against the
dark mountain. The French from the heights of Kisova
were shooting down into this plain.</p>

<p>It was terrible; it was grand. It was cruel; it was
sublime. My emotions almost overcame me. Major
Todorovitch, noticing my agitation, thought I was unstrung
and wished to return to the rear.</p>

<p>"Do you not feel well?" he asked me.</p>

<p>"I feel&mdash;I feel like a man," I said.</p>

<p>It was the only way I could express myself. I understood
now how men fought and died, and were willing
to fight and die innumerable times if it were possible for
their country. If some of my sisters who cry for peace
at any price could have seen the grandeur of this war in
a just cause I am sure they would feel as I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Major Todorovitch leaped to his feet and grasped both
my hands. I thought he would crush the bones.</p>

<p>"Come," he cried, "you are one of us. You shall have
the greatest honor of us all."</p>

<p>Dragging me to the edge of the precipice, where had
a Bulgarian officer seen him a burst of shrapnel would
have greeted him, he planted his feet firmly against a solid
rock.</p>

<p>"Lean over!" he cried enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Holding to his hands, my arms straining behind me,
I leaned far over the edge of the precipice. I seemed suspended
over the very heart of the battle. It seemed
for a moment as though the spirit of the war had caught
me up and flown with me where the whole fabric of the
world conflict was being woven beneath my feet.</p>

<p>"Now," cried the Major, "you are further into Serbia&mdash;Serbia
reconquered&mdash;than the bravest of our brave have
been. No Serbian fighting man has yet been so close
to Monastir."</p>

<p>The fineness of his compliment could not have been
excelled.</p>

<p>I had been told that I might remain upon the summit
of Dobrpolje an hour, but the scene fascinated me so
and my soldier escorts were so chivalrous that they gave
in to me and it was not until nightfall that they dragged
me away to the rear, although we had reached the summit
about midday.</p>

<p>Once more we were in the backwash of the battle.
The roads were lined with stretcher bearers and in the
stretchers lay men whose blood dripped through the canvas
and stained the dust of the roads&mdash;the dust for
which they were fighting and dying and suffering the tortures
of the damned.</p>

<p>From the <i>postes de secours</i> they were taken to the
rear in carts, and the steady rumble of the heavy wheels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
reminded me of the passing of the tumbrels in the "Tale
of Two Cities."</p>

<p>At one point we passed about 800 Bulgarian prisoners
and they did not seem at all unhappy at being out of the
fighting. It is a commentary on the nature of the Serbians
that they gave cigarettes to the prisoners, although
the Bulgars have committed nameless atrocities against
their foes and have devastated thousands of acres of
prune trees, thus destroying a lucrative and immense Serbian
industry.</p>

<p>That night Brod fell to the Serbs, but nevertheless I
had been that day further into Serbia than any of her
fighting sons at that time.</p>


<p>III&mdash;A WOMAN OFFICER OF THE CAVALRY</p>

<p>I do not know what silly things Major Todorovitch
told Gen. Vassitch, but the General, before all his staff,
made me an officer of the First Cavalry, which is the
crack Serbian regiment, and a uniform has been sent to
me and is on the way to the United States, although there
is not enough cloth in Serbia to clothe her own troops.
Perhaps when I go back I can use it, for although many
an officer offered me a horse, none proffered me a pair
of trousers to ride in.</p>

<p>When I was back in Salonica Prince Alexander sent
for me and with his own hands pinned on my breast the
Order of St. Sava, which is the most coveted of all the
Serbian orders.</p>

<p>When I asked him if he really thought I merited it,
he said, "I know of no better friend to Serbia than you."
I had already held the Kossova medal, which is given
only for personal attendance to the wounded, and the
Royal Order of the Serbian Red Cross.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Col. Sondermayer another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
woman and myself were smuggled into a dinner given to
Venizelos, at which no women were supposed to be present.
During the course of the dinner Venizelos suddenly
turned his head so that he happened to see me and started,
as might be expected at a dinner where women were excluded.
I also was covered with confusion and could
not help showing it.</p>

<p>The next day Col. Sondermayer called with an invitation
to visit Venizelos. When we reached his office he
was overwhelmed with work, but he rose from his chair
and said kindly, "Have I not seen your face before?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "last night at the dinner when you
turned your head and I lost mine."</p>

<p>He laughed, and we were engaged in conversation for
an hour. Venizelos entrusted me with a message for the
Greeks in America.</p>

<p>"Tell them," he said, "that we need them. If they
cannot come to fight they can send money, and it will
be used to take care of those who are fighting and those
who are left alone after the great battles."</p>

<p>I might refer here to the attitude of the women and
even the little children of Serbia and Greece. It is true
that the hardest, most cruel burdens of war fell upon
the women and the children who are left widows and
orphans or who suffer while the men are at the front.
It has always been so, but as in every patriotic nation the
women are suffering and doing their share as bravely
as the men. The soldiers are glad and proud to die for
their country, and their women folk and children are
proud to have them, despite the sorrow and privation.</p>

<p>It should be a lesson to us in America. Our men and
our women and children would be as ready and as willing
to bear their burdens, but now in peace and prosperity
we should prepare against the time when we may have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
take up our burdens so that they may fall no more heavily
than is necessary.</p>

<p>Venizelos is above all a Greek.</p>

<p>"I do not care for myself or for what may become of
me," he said. "I am working and living and will die for
Greece. Greece must live and live in glory and integrity."</p>

<p>Salonica seemed to me the concentrated essence of life.
It is a kaleidoscopic scene. You come across the uniform
of pretty nearly every nationality, and every known language
seems to be spoken. There are soldiers and refugees,
Turks and Christians, Greeks and Jews, and the
town hums like a beehive day and night. Troops are
coming and going, not only white men but negroes, Sudanese,
Congoese, Annamese and many others.</p>

<p>When I was in Serbia I had scooped up a handful of
earth and had treasured it and brought it back with me
to Salonica, where I showed it to some Serbs. Tears
came into their eyes and they gazed upon it with a reverence
worthy of a sacred relic.</p>

<p>One man thrust his hand into it and said, "You have
had the honor and the joy, which, alas, I have not had,
of setting foot on Serbian soil freed from the invader.
But I swear to you by this sacred earth that I will not die
until I have kissed the soil of my country. After
that&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>By now this man, who was a soldier, may have fulfilled
his vow, and if so he is happy, though his kiss may have
been a dying breath.</p>

<h2>"KAMERADS"!&mdash;CAPTURING HUNS
IN THE ALPS WITHOUT
A FIGHT</h2>

<p class="center"><i>An Extract from the Diary of a Lieutenant of
Alpine Chasseurs</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Set down by Henri Viard</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A racy story told by a young French subaltern, showing how six
Alpine Chasseurs bluffed three hundred Huns, with eight officers,
into surrendering without a fight.&mdash;In the <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF SCOUTING IN THE ALPS</p>

<p>At 5 a.m. on a certain day orders were received for an
attempt to drive the enemy from certain strong entrenchments.</p>

<p>To baffle observation, we went forward through the
woods. Connection between units was very awkward to
maintain, and, many a time, the direction would have
been lost were we not guided by the sound of the guns.
Nothing but the distant booming of Fritz's cannon and
the occasional explosion of a shell broke the forest hush.
In Indian file, with scouts some distance ahead, we
scrambled through the undergrowth, our feet frequently
caught by roots and all kinds of clinging impedimenta, our
faces lashed by brambles. We were eager and silent.
When exasperated by obstacles, the men swore in dumb
show. The orders were to keep mum; so mum we kept.</p>

<p>One's imagination was at work, though, and this warpath-treading
business was to me a sort of reminiscence.
Had I not lived it before? When a boy, reading Fenimore
Cooper and similar authors, I sometimes played at
"Pathfinder"; now as a man I felt as if I really was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
"paleface" leading a surprise party through virgin backwoods
after redskins. Of a truth, the savages that had
come upon us from the northern prairies were far worse
than Sioux, Cheyennes, Hurons, or Kickapoos. They
had sung the She-go-dem, they had sent out the tomahawk
and yearned for our scalps. Well, we'll have theirs
instead.</p>

<p>At last, the two leading companions, Captain B&mdash;&mdash;'s
and my own, reached the edge of the woods and espied
the village, four hundred yards away, all bright in the
morning sun. The bulk of the battalion had not come
up yet. Captain B&mdash;&mdash; turned and asked, "What next?"</p>

<p>"<i>Allons-y!</i>" we replied; "the others will follow suit."
Accordingly we massed up quickly in two columns, just
outside the cover, and then, "Forward!"</p>

<p>A rush, a pounce&mdash;we were intent on catching them.
Whew! Caught a crab! The hornets had flown&mdash;the
nest is empty. Where are the brutes? We meant to
surprise them, but, by Jove, they gave us an eye-opener.</p>

<p>The solitary thoroughfare descending to the bridge
was enfiladed by four machine-guns ambuscaded on the
other side of the water. The moment we got into this
beastly funnel the hose was turned on and torrents of
bullets splashed by. I leapt to the right, my comrade to
the left side of the street, and we fell flat into whatever
recesses the walls offered. So long as those deadly jets
continued the road was impassable. We could only communicate
by shouts, but fortunately our vocal chords are
sound. The guns made an infernal din. The bullets
ricocheted with vicious hisses&mdash;pish, whizz, zizz&mdash;striking
sparks from flints, zigzagging about, grazing the roadway,
raising clouds of dust that hung like a fog overhead.</p>

<p>I squatted my Chasseurs behind the church buttresses,
and from these shelters they made faces at their comrades
over the way and exchanged banter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put your hand out to see whether there is a draught!"
yelled one.</p>

<p>"Can't hear. Come and tell dad, ducky," came the retort.</p>

<p>Irrepressible boys! Danger seems to sharpen their
wits.</p>

<p>Presently an order reached me&mdash;Heaven knows how&mdash;to
look out and select whatever "combat position" I could
for my men.</p>

<p>But what position was I to select? I couldn't see much
of a panorama from my hole. I must go out and reconnoitre.</p>

<p>I called for a volunteer, and every man in the platoon
answered, "I, sir! I, sir!" Nearest, best heard. A glance
at the fellow next to me. It was Pierrat, a brick. He
would do. So, my steps dogged by this hardy terrier, I
began to play hide and seek from enclosure to enclosure,
dodging down towards the river. Now a back yard, now
an orchard, had to be negotiated. They were tricky
places; you never knew whether you wouldn't come to a
dead stop before you were half-way through. From time
to time, whenever a fresh bit of shelter is reached, without
looking back, I called out to Pierrat: "Keeping on?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, oui</i>," he answered, and it was a comfort to be
sure that my faithful shadow was still at my heels.</p>


<p>II&mdash;A DASH ACROSS THE DEATH ZONE</p>

<p>When we were almost at the bottom of the declivity
I descried near the bridge, but on the other side of the
road, the railway station. A nice position, this&mdash;quite
my fancy. Suppose we occupied it! But it must be investigated
first, and&mdash;well, it was on the other side of the
road. My rifleman and I took a long look at the building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and calculated the distance between it and us, and cast a
wistful look at each other.</p>

<p>"Rum job, sir," Pierrat agreed. Then, after a moment's
consideration, he blurted out: "But I've an idea.
Let us make the dash together. The odds are that one
of the two will get over."</p>

<p>"Quite so," I told him. "Yet, if I'm the one who does
not, will <i>you</i> take command of the fellows?"</p>

<p>He hesitated for a second, took another look at me, and
then answered, resolutely, "Why not, sir?"</p>

<p>I shook hands with my new-found successor and, in
two leaps the seven-league-booted ogre would have been
proud of, we were across the death-zone. Thence,
crawling through some gardens, we reached the station
unscathed. I got into what had been the waiting-room
and the station-master's tiny office. Broken chairs, topsy-turvy
tables, lacerated prints, smashed telephone and
telegraph fixtures, and empty bottles galore strewed the
floor. Wherever Teutons have been, "dead" bottles are
certain to be found.</p>

<p>"Drunkards!" grumbled Pierrat, probably feeling very
dry.</p>

<p>While I was observing the bridge and mill through the
waiting-room's glass door, a stray bullet came crashing
in to frame my head in a star of cracks, just under a
clean round hole. A fig for aureoles! I'm not a saint yet,
nor a hero&mdash;which fact I demonstrated instantly by a
most unheroic back-start. The place was unhealthy; I
would have a look elsewhere. Accordingly I went out on
the platform. The part for passengers was too exposed&mdash;only
fit for express despatch into the other world&mdash;but
what of the goods department? Merchandise has a
knack of lingering on local lines, so provident authorities
build weather-proof accommodation for it. This goods
depot was a splendid specimen of the sort, with stout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
breast-high walls, formerly glass roofed. The glass being
already smashed, it would not crash down on the men;
but the walls stood, a strong parapet from behind which
an efficient fire could be poured into hostile trenches.</p>

<p>I had got my combat position!</p>

<p>The trouble now was to man it. How many of my
fellows would live to cross that bullet-swept road? Well,
we should see. The first thing was to try and fetch them.</p>

<p>Leaving Pierrat with strict injunctions to keep under
cover and have a nap if he liked, but on no account to
attract the enemy's attention, I sneaked back somehow
to my platoon and ordered a move. "Every man will
shift for himself," I told them. "Rendezvous this side
of the road opposite the station." I knew Chasseurs
could be trusted to find their way through anything. My
only doubt was whether I should not be outpaced. As
a matter of fact, I was by no means the first in, yet not
the last.</p>

<p>When everybody had joined but those whom it would
be no use to wait for, I bade them crouch behind me in
a line on the verge of the bullet stream, ready to plunge
ahead the moment they heard the word.</p>

<p>Presently there came a lull. "Over, lads!"</p>

<p>And over we went. Some did not reach the other side.
There are tombs opposite the station, each marked by a
little wooden cross with a tam-o'-shanter on top, which
will be tended so long as any one of us is left. How
many? There was no time to count them just then.</p>

<p>At last we were in the station.</p>

<p>Here I concealed the men behind the parapet, with instructions
to cut loopholes and amuse themselves by
potting at whatever was worth a shot. At first they did
not make much practice. Little by little, however, they
spotted places where the Huns offered a target, and then
there was sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever a silhouette jerked into view, all my Chasseurs
giggled for glee. They arranged a sort of rotation
between the best shots, and no one would give up his
turn to snipe. Pending developments, the more indifferent
marksmen watched their comrades' practice, and at
each "bull's-eye" a murmur of approval came from the
spectators. One of them, a youngster, could scarcely
control his excitement. He had a quick eye and, being
often the first to catch a glimpse of something, yelped like
a boy on his first morning out after grouse. "Here's
stuff!" he cried. "Here's stuff!" His neighbour, a
steady, unerring killer, suspected of poaching propensities
in civilian life, used unconventional language under his
breath at each exclamation. At last, as the tyro uttered
a shout a little louder than usual, he gave him a vicious
kick, bawling, "Hold your row!" The contrast between
the advice and the stentorian way in which it was imparted
made everybody smile&mdash;even the kicked one, who
retorted, good-humouredly, "Keep your nerve, mate, or
you won't shoot straight!"</p>

<p>Noon. Upon my word, this little game seemed as if it
could go on indefinitely, for the Germans, their attention
concentrated on the village, which they kept riddling with
bullets, had not "registered" us yet.</p>

<p>I contemplated the bridge with longing, greedy eyes,
for I felt mad to get to the other side of it. At last I
ventured to send a suggestion up to my C.O. Back came
the reply: "What's the sense of risking a bearer's life
to transmit unnecessary messages? Pocket your pluck
and stay where you are."</p>

<p>The time dragged awfully. What would introduce
novelty into the situation? I was just "fed up" with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>


<p>III&mdash;THE PLATOON AT THE CASTLE WALLS</p>

<p>About 4 p.m. the scene changed. From somewhere, like
bolts from the blue, six-inch shells began to shower down,
not on us, but in front of us. It made all the difference.</p>

<p>It was our own guns, firing at the Huns, and the first
shots, somewhat short, fell in the river, sending up superb
water-jets which the now oblique sun illuminated with all
the colours of the rainbow. At times, spray splashed
down right upon us and, though there is nothing particularly
nice about a shower-bath when one is not in the undress
for it, we laughed at the quip the sprinkling elicited
from a Parisian: "Well spouted, Versailles waterworks!"</p>

<p>But our gunners soon found the exact range, and
houses and enemy trenches and their contents began to
play fireworks, with stones and pebbles and heads and
limbs for stars and rockets. The Huns did not seem to
like this; we could see them reel back. After each <i>rafale</i>,
my men were so elated at the ensuing stampede that most
of them popped up in full view over the parapet, cheering
like mad, and forgot to shoot.</p>

<p>Presently our C.O. came down to the station and decided
that the town should be entered. I had been the
first to get near the bridge, and no one disputed my right
to be the first across. "Fix bayonets and forward!" My
men, highly-strung by protracted tantalization, rushed
headlong into the village. I expected the Germans to
counter with cold steel, but nothing of the sort happened.
Where were the beggars? We searched the buildings.
In the mill I found only three blanched Bavarians hidden
away behind sacks of flour, and holes were promptly
driven through the lot, sacks and all.</p>

<p>I formed my platoon up in two small columns, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
orders to advance crouching along the dykes on both
sides of the road, which was still swept by machine-guns.
Suddenly the <i>crécelles</i> ceased rattling, and I perceived
against the enclosure wall of the castle a man signalling
to us. I did not know for a moment what to make of
his gesticulations, but I could see that he wore red trousers.
It was "Come on!" that he was signalling. On,
then, and the Evil One take the hindmost!</p>

<p>I heard later that the fellow was a prisoner and risked
everything to give us a useful hint.</p>

<p><i>Pardieu!</i> he did. He rendered the battalion an invaluable
service that eventide.</p>

<p>The instant I realized the red-trousered signaller's
meaning I guessed that something out of the common
must be taking place within the castle. With my sergeant
and four men, revolver in hand, I bounded at the
double ahead of the platoon and threw myself against
the entrance door. It crashed open, and I tumbled against
six feet of grey-coated "Kultur."</p>

<p>Blood and fury! My left hand flew at his throat,
clutched it, and gave it a violent twist, while my right
tried to level the shooting-iron between his eyes. They
met mine, and something in them made me shout in German,
"Do you surrender?" He seemed to hesitate for
the fraction of a second; then he gasped in pure French,
"That was my intention." I relaxed my hold, and he
added, calmly, "<i>La guerre est une chose effroyable. Je
me constitue prisonnier</i>."</p>

<p>Very civil, I am sure. I felt I ought to bow, for classical
language like this knocks a fellow a couple of centuries
back. It knocked every glimmer of passion out of me.
I recovered self-possession in a jiffy and&mdash;to make
amends for whatever bad form there might have been
in my recent exhibition of excitement&mdash;turned round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
majestically and surveyed the situation with lordly composure.</p>

<p>Jove!</p>

<p>In the huge yard were some three hundred Huns. The
sight gave me a start, but I showed no emotion. Why
didn't they shoot, though? They looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"I ask for the lives of my men," said the well-bred
voice behind me. The tall jackanapes, it appeared, was
their <i>Hauptmann</i> (Captain). Was he, then, surrendering
the lot as well as himself?</p>

<p>I couldn't believe it, but I acted as if it was a matter
of course.</p>

<p>"Granted," I growled, without turning a hair, "but
arms down and hands up!"</p>

<p>"Ground arms!" bawled the German's voice. Scarcely
had the command rung out when, like clockwork, forward
bent three hundred automatons, down went three
hundred rifles, and up again to attention stood three hundred
disarmed boobies.</p>

<p>"Hands up!" Up went six hundred paws, and three
hundred hoarse voices chorused "Kamerads! Kamerads!"</p>

<p>Ripping! I could have yelled with joy at the sight
and shouted "Bravo!" But not a sound escaped my
lips. Instead I folded my arms and remained motionless,
looking very fierce, I dare say.</p>

<p>Wouldn't there have been a hullabaloo if somebody had
guessed what thoughts were passing through the poor
brain inside that stern figure?</p>


<p>IV&mdash;A DARING RUSE&mdash;AND SURRENDER</p>

<p>Presently, seven officers stepped out, marched up, fell
in behind my prisoner, and extended the hilts of their
swords to me. "Keep 'em," I ordered, dryly; "you'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
give 'em to my C.O. Now let's move off, and be sharp!"</p>

<p>"May I beg leave to tell my men they will not be shot?"
the Captain asked.</p>

<p>"Very well," I told him; "but don't be long about it."</p>

<p>He went towards his docile crowd and gave them the
welcome assurance. Evidently they had been taught that
the French give no quarter. I wished he would make
a speech, for the whole point for me was to gain time so
that supports might arrive. Back he came, and I was in a
sweat with the perspiration oozing from my temples.
When was he going to see that there were only four men,
one N.C.O., and my anxious self on the premises?</p>

<p>Having placed my quartette of Chasseurs and the sergeant
on guard at the ward end of the archway, so as
to prevent any of the rats in the trap peeping out, I
went with a thumping heart to the outer door and took a
glance up the road. Hurrah! My platoon had crept up
along the ditches. "Up with you!" I shouted, and, screening
myself round the corner of the gateway, added, in
a lower tone, "Do not look surprised." Then, aloud, I
yelled: "Prisoners' escort! About-turn!"</p>

<p>It would never do to give the German officers a chance
of realizing how enormously their men outnumbered
mine, so I quickly returned to where the <i>Hauptmann</i> and
his subalterns stood in a disconsolate group.</p>

<p>"You remain with me, gentlemen," I told them. "Make
your men form fours and file out."</p>

<p>"Right! Fours! March!"</p>

<p>When the last four passed out&mdash;the whole of the idiots
leaving their rifles and bayonets in the yard, of course&mdash;I
ordered "Halt," and with the eight specimens of Hunnish
officerdom swinging behind me in step, moved deliberately
to the head of the column.</p>

<p>The enemy being now disarmed, I could afford a little
more bluff; besides, through an extraordinary piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
luck, there were just enough survivors of my platoon left
to make up the exact regulation number for a prisoners'
escort.</p>

<p>"Quick march!" I ordered.</p>

<p>Off we moved, the Captain by my side, the lieutenants
following respectfully three paces behind.</p>

<p>On the way towards the bridge, I thought I detected
from the corner of my eye the <i>Hauptmann</i> giving me,
once or twice, a sidelong glance. I pretended, however,
not to see, looking steadily in front, watching anxiously
for my supports. Here they are! The Colonel has caught
sight of us and is advancing rapidly at the head of the
battalion.</p>

<p>I heaved a deep sigh, which did not escape the Captain's
attention, for he turned to me inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Allow me to introduce you to my commanding officer,"
I said, with a graceful smile, the full irony of which
he probably did not fathom.</p>

<p>I do not think that particular Bavarian has made out
to this day how it all came to pass. Let him try and
tackle the mystery on the sunny Mediterranean shore,
where chivalrous France affords captive officers ample
and comfortable leisure.</p>

<p>So far as I understand it, the man thought superior
forces had surrounded the castle, leaving no chance of
escape. Feeling entrapped and labouring under the delusion
that any further attempt at defence would be futile,
his anxiety to save his men became uppermost in
his mind. As to the men themselves, when they saw
their captain surrender and heard no officer order anything,
discipline made them remain inactive. The moment
the Captain's command to "ground arms" rang out, discipline
caused them to lay their rifles down without further
thought or ado. One of them, whom I asked what
induced them to throw their hands up, replied, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
astounded at the question: "Why, we were ordered to."</p>

<p>But what about the seven subalterns? Of course, they
could not see through walls, and discipline, I imagine,
made them "follow their leader" like the men.</p>

<p>If so, discipline be hanged! It is a comfort to think
that had a French officer been weak enough to behave
as their chief did in similar circumstances, there would
have been someone there to blow his brains out and lead
the company to a sortie. But what is the use of moralizing?
Leopards do not change their spots. Besides, a
gift horse should not be looked in the mouth, and the
<i>Hauptmann</i> did me, at any rate, a good turn.</p>

<p>Before taking leave of him that evening I inquired
what he thought of Alpine Chasseurs. His reply is
worth recording, the first words so unexpected from one
of the inventors of "frightfulness," the last ones eulogistic,
after all.</p>

<p>"To begin with," he declared, "your artillery is diabolical.
The use of such weapons ought to be prohibited.
It is murder! As to your men, they are extraordinary.
The way they creep along is inimitable. Hardly has one
got a glimpse of them than&mdash;<i>houp-là!</i> they are on the
top of you."</p>

<p>Then, after a pause, he added, emphatically:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are wild-cats!"</p>

<i>Current History</i>. Especially interesting is M. Milan's account
of the part played by wireless telegraphy in the war.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF WAR ON THE ADRIATIC SEA</p>

<p>At last, on the curve of the waves, is marked the
outline of the enemy! Alas! They are only torpedo-boat
destroyers! Swift and powerful destroyers, I admit,
but Austria might very well have offered us an
adversary of our own class. But let us be satisfied with
the windfall. Too many days have been thrown away
against invisible adversaries. These at least are real,
living and full of ardour. They gallop toward us, torpedoes
pointed; we point toward them our big guns,
which cannot yet reach them; the game is equal. Like
us, they have run up the battle-flag, and the <i>Waldeck-Rousseau</i>,
driving over the waters like a thoroughbred,
drags with her her cruisers and her two squadrons of
torpedo boats to the adventure in which some one must
die.</p>

<p>A few minutes pass, packed with anxious silence. The
men shut up in the hidden vitals of the ship strain their
ears to catch the muffled sound of the first salvo; they
may be killed in a moment, if some well-pointed torpedo
should touch the cruiser, but they give their whole souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of bronze to their apparatus and their machines, so that
nothing may go wrong in this marvelous crisis. Through
their range-finders, the gun-pointers watch the distance
vanishing by a kind of miracle. Twenty thousand yards&mdash;eighteen
thousand yards&mdash;fifteen thousand&mdash;fourteen
thousand. Two thousand yards more, and the storm of
our artillery will break over our adversary. In three
parallel lines the Austrian destroyers pour forth torrents
of smoke; they are in solid formation; each line
glides over the blue water like a gleaming boa constrictor.
Alongside of us our torpedo-boat destroyers
have drawn together and are plowing up clouds of foam
that sparkle like silver in the sun.</p>

<p>But what do we see over there? The Austrian lines
open out, bend upon themselves, and their heads describe
a wide curve. Is it possible? They are going away!
They refuse to fight! With a raging anguish we all try
to persuade ourselves that our eyes are deceiving us.
It is a trick of the sunshine, a puff of wind that bends
their smoke. * * * Not at all. They have completed
their turning movement and show us their heels,
looking like three railroad trains speeding away on rails
of foam.</p>

<p>Oh! to have our eyes on our revenge for so many
useless weeks, and to see it escape just at the limit
beyond the reach of our guns! To feel that under our
feet our gigantic machines, which, nevertheless, are not
weakening, can no longer catch up with the prey whose
legs are too long for us! To measure the distance, and
to feel it growing greater, a little more each second,
like an elastic that is being stretched! Fourteen thousand
yards!</p>

<p>Fourteen thousand one hundred. Fourteen thousand
two hundred. * * * Ah! we would fain command
the waves, hurl a sudden hurricane into the air, churn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the sea into foam and billows. Our potent keels would
not slow down, but the destroyers would crash against
each billow, would go slower, would exhaust their force,
and our triumphant dash would overmatch their cowardice.</p>

<p>They flee toward the labyrinth of the Dalmatian
Islands, which grow larger before us like a family of
ocean monsters rising from the sea. We continue to
pursue. Sixteen thousand&mdash;seventeen thousand yards.
Perhaps the poltroons will be seized with remorse or
indecision. But it is not so; their flight is a premeditated
ruse. High up in the sky, slipping and gliding among the
transparent clouds, a war plane swoops over the French
warships, passes along them, and drops bombs that only
our skillful dodging makes harmless; they burst opposite
our ships. On the surface of the water one of the cruisers
perceives the furrow of a periscope! Some lurking
submarine has launched its torpedoes, perhaps; our
speed has deceived it; no one is touched; we take a flying
shot at the streak of foam, which instantly disappears.
The submarine plunges into the depths, the aeroplane is
already out of sight, and the destroyers are close to the
channel of the archipelago. Eighteen thousand yards&mdash;nineteen
thousand.</p>


<p>II&mdash;IN THE WAKE OF A TORPEDO</p>

<p>After a few hours of unquiet dozing I arose, made a
summary toilet, ate I know not what food, swallowed
hastily, before going on watch. In the middle of the day
I found myself on the bridge again. A bright sun was
silvering the distance. The three cruisers, deployed in
loose order, continued their course toward the south of
the Adriatic; behind, almost invisible, the smoke of the
naval forces formed a black mane on the horizon. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
board, every one who was not on duty was enjoying a
siesta. Every one was finding consolation in dreams for
the disappointments of the day before, but a few scores
of eyes were watching the very calm sea. The <i>Ernest-Renan</i>,
a few thousand yards away, was following a
parallel course.</p>

<p>Something very white suddenly appeared in the furrows
of foam. My binocular immediately followed this
wrinkle on the water; you would have said a jet of
steam, slipping along just under the surface. For a few
seconds I hesitated. Perhaps the fin of a porpoise swimming
close to the top deceived me. The remembrance of
training in peace times brought back to my memory the
track of a periscope, and I hesitated no longer.</p>

<p>"Quick! All on the left! Raise to eight hundred
meters! Declination, forty! All engines at full speed
ahead! Close the bulkheads! Begin firing!"</p>

<p>The cruiser bounds. In the hold the men of the watch
close the bulkheads. The artillery fires. The shells fall
around the white, moving streak. They burst like balls
of dry snow on a blue wall. All the men, awakened from
their siesta, all the officers come up on deck. A few
meters from our hull passes the fleecy track of a torpedo
launched against us. It has missed us, but a big 194
shell (7&frac34; inch), fired from one of our turrets bursts
immediately above the periscope. It plows the water and
splashes it up in the air; the stem of the periscope rises,
falls, rises again, falls again, as a wounded animal tries
to stand and falls again. Then nothing more is seen.
The blue waves show only their habitual indolence.
Across the void a storm of cheers comes to us from the
<i>Ernest-Renan</i>; they have seen the shell tearing up the
water, and they are certain that the explosions have
crushed in the submarine.</p>

<p>We are going fast, so fast that in a few seconds the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
cruiser is far from the place of death. The guns turn
and follow it, ready to fire again, but nothing shows
any more.</p>

<p>"Cease firing! As you were! Open the bulkheads!
Resume your course! Engines at sixty revolutions!"</p>


<p>III&mdash;DIVINE SERVICE ON A WARSHIP</p>

<p>Every Sunday, divine service is celebrated on board&mdash;a
serious, simple ceremony. Around the movable altar,
flags stretched make stained-glass windows of bunting;
the vault of the church is formed by the low whitewashed
ceiling of the space between decks; to right and
left, the partitions of the cabins, the white stems of the
smokestacks, form the metal walls of the shrine; the
parti-coloured tubes, steam pipes, well-polished cocks,
cast red and yellow reflections; chairs for the officers,
benches for the crew, are grouped to a depth of eight or
ten yards. He comes who so desires. A bugle call announces
services, and whoever is not on duty, either
comes or stays away. While the priest is accomplishing
the holy rites, you hear in the hold the breathing of the
engines, the snoring of the ventilators; above your head,
on deck, patter the sailors of the watch; the big Adriatic
rollers slap against the hull and the quivering of the
rapidly moving cruiser makes the altar tremble.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;THE BOOTY OF THE HIGH SEAS</p>

<p>Above the horizon appear the masts, smokestacks, and
hull of a ship. Whether her conscience be troubled or
at rest, she knows she cannot escape our speed, and does
not try to fly. At 5,000 yards her flag informs us of
her nationality. English or French, she may go ahead.
If she is neutral we show her the international signal:</p>

<p>"Stop immediately!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>And stop she must. If she looks like going on, a
blank cannon shot warns her not to play with fire. If
she pretends not to understand the invitation, a shell
falls just ahead of her, and lets her know we are not
joking. If her screw continues to revolve a rap or two
on the hull lets her know that the affair is serious. They
always stop in time.</p>

<p>The cruiser comes to, within gun range of the suspect.
In an instant one of our boats is lowered into the water,
the crew seize the oars; the officer on duty, armed with
a sword and a revolver, and with a big register under
his arm, jumps into the boat, which pushes off.</p>

<p>"Captain, kindly range on deck all persons on board!
Let each have his identification papers in his hand. I
shall inspect them in five minutes!"</p>

<p>Stewardesses, stewards scatter through the cabins,
which are filled with a sudden stir. In the midst of a
concert of exclamations, murmurs, and laughter, feverish
fingers dive into portfolios and bags. Travelers whose
souls are white immediately find what is wanted; the
ladies fix their hair, hastily dab a little powder on a suspicion
of sunburn, and give themselves a finishing touch.
The whole thing is tremendously amusing to them. Just
as if it were on the stage! It would not take much to
make them put on their prettiest dresses. But the officer
is getting impatient, and the Captain is apologizing; one
passenger cannot find his passport, which he thinks he
has left in his trunk. Exactly! the story is an old one!
But let this German quarry climb up, just as he is!</p>

<p>Finally, every one is drawn up in two or several lines&mdash;like
a row of blind men holding out their trays, each one
holds his passport. The men are extremely serious, almost
indignant, and, behind their foreheads, you can
divine silent tempests; they are on the watch for an imprudent
word, in order to invoke their Consuls, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Ambassadors, and the inviolable rights of neutrals. A
vain hope. The officer sharply scans them, and turns
over their papers with a careful finger. Stamps and paragraphs
are in order, and also the description; the passports,
the certificate of nationality, do not smell of trickery.
But there is no touchstone like language; a few
words, a few phrases, tell many secrets to expert ears,
and hesitation shows guilt where the papers show innocence.</p>

<p>"Be so good as to tell me where you come from. Be
so good as to tell me your name and your birthday. Have
you been long abroad? Be so good as to answer in your
own language. What is your profession?"</p>

<p>You must question pointblank, in different ways, and
be careful not to carry on the conversation. No discussion,
an instantaneous judgment, and you pass on.</p>

<p>The true prizes, the genuine booty, you recognize by
sure symptoms&mdash;Germanic faces, Teutonic accents, harsh
or honeyed answers, stammered explanations. In vain do
they disguise their names and hand us forged writings,
their Germanic race leaks through all their pores. They
are hurrying to foment rebellion in Egypt or Tripoli;
they are on their way to the Balkans to do their work;
to burrow underground in India or China. Invariably
they have Swiss or Dutch passports, but their certificate
of nationality, brand new, is fresh from the printing
press, and reminds you of false coins, too new and shiny.
Suspects! The officer goes down to their cabins. Under
the mattress, behind the washstand, in the folds of
a counterpane, lie the incriminating papers. Enemies!</p>

<p>From this point, one must go on decisively, gracefully,
in the French fashion. The officer halts in front of
the German, addresses him by name, lays a light finger
on his sleeve or shoulder, and says, without raising his
voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"I arrest you. Follow my sailor, who will take your
baggage and put you into the boat."</p>

<p>Cries, explosions of anger, insults must not disturb
him. He must add nothing. What has been said has
been said.</p>


<p>V&mdash;STORY OF THE WIRELESS AT SEA&mdash;THE
SECRET LANGUAGE</p>

<p>We have on board an ear that never sleeps; it is the
wireless telegraph. The apparatus is buried in the depths
of the hold; a padded cabin isolates the operators from
the noise of the machinery and the cross-currents of
discord. From watch to watch the telegraphers pass
over the receiver to each other, and the finest murmurs
never escape their vigilance.</p>

<p>The air vibrates in an uninterrupted concert. Coming
from stations near or far, from ships wandering on the
Atlantic or close at hand, calls, conversations seek out
their way; the ether transmits them instantaneously. The
powerful antennae of the Eiffel Tower, of Ireland, of
Germany, of Italy, or of Constantinople dominate with
their noisy throats the feeble whispers. With their full
force, to any distance, they launch the official news of
the great ordeal. If some one talks too loudly, 500 or
1,000 kilometers away, (300 to 600 miles,) they raise
their tones, throw more strength into their voices, until
the interrupters become silent.</p>

<p>A tacit agreement alternates their messages. The German
does not obstruct the Frenchman, the Turk waits
until Malta has finished. Madrid, talking to Berlin, rests
while London speaks. For these great stations, controlled
by their Governments, send out only announcements
of the first importance, such as the whole world
should know, and they wish neither to confuse nor to
be confused. Reports from the front, happenings at sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
diplomatic or financial transactions, plans or insults, circulate
in all languages, and you can be certain that the
newspapers will not publish them. If by chance the
reader of newspapers finds them in his daily sheet, it will
be a week or a fortnight later, in a garbled, unrecognizable
form.</p>

<p>Sailors hear every bell and every sound; while the rest
of the world must be content with the meagre, delayed
communications authorized by the censorship, the sailor
already knows. His griefs and joys precede the griefs
and joys of the anxiously waiting millions. Ireland announces
a simple movement of Russian strategy, but
Norddeich&mdash;the German post&mdash;clamors to all the echoes
of a German victory, an advance, the capture of thousands
of prisoners. Norddeich laconically explains some
event at sea, but Eiffel sets his biggest sparks cracking,
announcing to Moscow, to Newfoundland, to the Sudan
and the Red Sea the disaster at sea that has befallen
some Teutonic force. In how many days, with how many
changes, will the public read these bits of news? At
every hour of the day and night we receive them brutal
and imperious.</p>

<p>No illusions are permitted to us. Our enemies do not
lie too grossly in these proclamations destined for their
Ambassadors, their Consuls, the innumerable agents who
uphold the prestige of Germany throughout the world;
it is vital for Germany that these men should receive
authentic information, which they will make the most of
in their bargainings. There is nothing in common between
the rhapsodies of her newspapers or of the Wolff
Agency and her wireless announcements. At the most,
in the case of defeats, she sends out statements made
carefully vague. But this very vagueness makes us prick
up our ears, and within a few hours London or Paris confirms
the English or French victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Outside the Chancelleries and Governments, there are
no day-to-day records of the war except on warships.
We discuss squarely over flags placed exactly where they
ought to be; our forecasts, our hopes are rarely deceived.
And if the obligation of secrecy did not impose silence
upon us we could tell our friends many a bit of news.</p>

<p>But underneath the great tenors of wireless telegraphy
whisper the myriads of baritones, basses, members of the
chorus. Thus in the tropical forest the roaring of lions
by no means hinders the dialogues of insects and rodents;
this network of lower voices gives the jungle its deep
life. The slender tones of talking ships fill the atmosphere
of the sea with a mysterious animation. A big
liner, come from tropical seas, announces her passage
of such and such a frequented cape. A torpedo-boat
patrolling toward Gibraltar tells Port Said about the
ships which it has sighted. This torpedo-boat has not
got strong enough lungs to shout to the other end of the
Mediterranean; it calls Bizerta or Toulon, who answers,
takes its message, and relays it forward, like a rebounding
ball, to the antennae of Malta, to the masts of a
French cruiser in the Ionian Sea, to the wires of a Russian
ship in the Ægean, and finally it reaches Port Said.
A mailboat announces its position, a squadron asks for
orders, a naval attaché or an ambassador sends out information
gained by spies; the Resident General of Morocco
is sending wheat to Montenegro; the main guards
give warning that a submarine is in sight; colliers ask
to be told exactly where they are to meet certain cruisers;
the whole Mediterranean taps the antennae of the
Commander in Chief as a swarm of subalterns tap at the
door of military headquarters.</p>

<p>No disorder, no discord in these gusts of whisperings.
Like the musicians in a well-drilled orchestra, all these
talkers speak at the minute, at the second previously fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
for their turn; chronometer in hand, the telegraph operators
watch for the instant allotted to them, and immediately
send forth trills of short, brief notes; whether
they have finished or not at the end of their period,
they stop and wait, for immediately a distant voice begins
its part, and would protest violently if any one prevented
its speaking. The whole extent of the Mediterranean
is divided into sectors, the time is cut up into fragments,
and no one is allowed to break the silence if the
pre-established table bids him keep still.</p>

<p>Besides, the guilty parties are quickly found out. Just
as the fingers of a blind man acquire surprising sensitiveness,
so the operators' ears distinguish the timbre, the
tone, the musical value of the chatters whom they have
never seen. For the initiated the electric radiations have
a personality like human speech. Two posts, two ships
have distinct voices, pronunciations. This one talks with
a sputter, the other speaks with solemn slowness; the
voice of one suggests a match scratched on sandpaper,
another buzzes like a fly, another sings small, like the
flight of mosquitoes. It is a concert almost magical. In
his padded cabin the operator hears and distinguishes
the whirr of the cricket, the squeak of the violin, the
rasped wing-cover of the beetle, the hiss of frying, which
the fantastic electricity is sending forth, hundreds of
leagues away. It flickers, ceases, begins again; you would
say a goblin symphony in some wide wilderness, and yet
the least of these vibrations is a message of war, of life
and of death.</p>

<p>And indeed they are careful not to talk without saying
anything. They all use only secret languages. This
perpetual chatter contains no word, no phrase which any
one can understand unless he possesses the key on which
rests the safety of ships. Cipher, cipher, cipher, nothing.</p>

<h2>OVER THE TOP WITH THE AMERICANS
IN THE FOREIGN LEGION</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Donald R. Thane, of the Foreign Legion of

<p>Back from the trenches, where he fought in the Foreign Legion
of France, Donald R. Thane, an American boy, was wounded
and "gassed" all in the same day. Mr. Thane has seen Mars
in his blackest moods; he has seen him at play and laughs at
some of the grim jests of the war god. His gossip of the
trenches&mdash;or rather some of it&mdash;just as he told it, nervously, and
coughing now and then, for his lungs are still raw from the
gas, gives an American boy's view of the war and what is going
on "out there."&mdash;Courtesy of the <i>New York Herald</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF AN AMERICAN BOY IN FRANCE</p>

<p>I was walking through Belgium when the war started.
Things began to get hot and I went over to Paris. It
was there that I enlisted in the Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>Why did I do it?</p>

<p>Well, I'm not going to pull anything about wanting
to rescue France, or being fired by the flame of liberty
or anything like that. They asked a negro prizefighter&mdash;an
American&mdash;the same thing. He ruefully regarded the
many bandages that adorned his more or less mangled
body, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, sah, I guess mah curiosity got de best ob mah
good sense."</p>

<p>Looking back on it, he answered for me, too.</p>

<p>As soon as I enlisted I became a number. It was No.
38,606, and I think that when we started to fight there
were about 65,000 men in the legion. I don't know how
many there are now. I do know that regiments have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
been so decimated that they were consolidated. You
must not think of a regiment of the legion, however, as
you do of an American regiment with a fixed number of
men. I have seen Zouave regiments with 43 companies
and about 240 men in each company.</p>

<p>I was assigned to the First regiment of the legion,
where there were a number of other Americans, about
whom I will tell you later. If the Americans had all
enlisted at about the same time probably they would have
had a separate regiment, but as they came in separately
they were scattered throughout the legion.</p>

<p>They sent us down to Lyons for about a month of
training, which was a lot more than was given at first.
Some of the men practically got uniforms and then went
into the trenches. I knew a French sergeant whose
brother enlisted and was killed ten days later.</p>

<p>At Lyons wounded officers and non-coms, taught us
soldiering without an interpreter. All the commands
were given in French, and the drill masters executed
them as they gave them. Lots of the boys didn't know a
word of French, but they soon learned to execute all
the movements, commence firing, cease firing, rush and
retire, to the French commands. That was all the officers
cared about. All we needed was to be able to fight
in French.</p>


<p>II&mdash;IN A LITTLE WOOD NEAR LASSIGNY</p>

<p>My regiment was stationed in a wood a little way south
of Lassigny, and for a time everything was very pleasant.
The Prussians couldn't see us, and we had to fear
only an occasional shell which came our way. The
Boches had a habit of combing the whole line once every
morning and once or twice toward evening. I suppose
it was just so we wouldn't get too "cocky."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment was divided into three parts. One-third
stayed up in the outpost trenches and did a little patrol
work in the woods. A second part was in the second-line
trenches, repairing them and ready to move up if an
attack came, and the third part was in the rear washing
up and resting.</p>

<p>The men on outpost had to be pretty careful, because
sometimes at night the Boches would move up and throw
a few grenades or take some pot shots at them, but on
the whole we were pretty comfortable in the woods at
Lassigny, getting used to the sound of shell fire and occasionally
experiencing what it is like to have some one
shoot at YOU, purposely&mdash;to kill you.</p>

<p>But this came to an end. One day the Prussians began
to pay a great deal of unsolicited attention to our
sector. Their artillery hammered at us incessantly all
day and all night. We knew an attack would come when
the artillery fire ceased, and more and more men were
moved into our trenches all the time.</p>

<p>I was sorry for the outposts, who had little or no protection
against this kind of fire, but who had to stay out
in the front to see when the attack started. The French
officers seemed to know about when the assault was due,
and one night they moved us out of the woods into a
more exposed position. Here we huddled in bombproofs
about thirty feet below the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>Shells were bursting all around us. We could hear the
earth and stones thrown up by the explosions come rattling
down on the roof of our shelter, and we always
looked up at the raftered ceiling and wondered if it was
going to hold. To die here like rats in a trap was not
what we expected. I had never been in an attack and
I dreaded it, but I thought surely it must be better than
this sitting here, waiting for the top of the ground to
fall down and crush me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The muffled roar of the cannon fire ceased. The assault
was commencing.</p>

<p>We sprang to the entrance of the passage which leads
to the world above. It was blocked by falling earth and
rocks. With spades, with bayonets, with bleeding fingers
and tattered nails we flew at the debris and clawed our
way to the air, like sewer rats at bay and forced to fight.</p>

<p>We wanted to fight. It was not all courage on our
part. If the Boches should win our trenches they would
throw hand grenades in on us until all was silent in our
self-made tomb, just as we would do if we reached their
lines.</p>

<p>It is a rotten war!</p>

<p>We scrambled out just as the third wave of Prussians
surged against the barbed wire entanglements and died
away. It did not break back upon itself, like a water
wave striking a breakwater. It simply melted, because
our machine guns were rat-a-tat-tatting and our artillery
was dropping a curtain of high explosives into a strip
of No Man's Land about as wide as a city street.</p>

<p>It was horrible. Yet as every shell burst we felt exultation,
because if those men passed the wire some of
US would die. We wanted them killed right there. We
did not want them to get among us, stabbing and shooting
and clubbing.</p>

<p>It was my first fight. I could not help it&mdash;I was afraid.
I wanted to get on my knees and pray that the gray waves
should not pass the barrier, but my knees were too stiff.
I prayed standing&mdash;prayed that more men would be
killed!</p>

<p>For three hours this kept up. I stood there horrified,
but for the first time in my life glad to see men die. No
more waves were coming. Night was falling. The red
in the sky seemed to be reflected in the narrow strip of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
ground before us, but it was not that. The guns spoke
more slowly.</p>

<p>Great God, it was over! They had not passed. I was
glad, but I was sick.</p>


<p>III&mdash;WE ATTACK THE PRUSSIAN TRENCHES</p>

<p>I spoke of the enemy coming over in waves. Many
persons seem to think that this implies a weird and complicated
formation. It does not. Nothing is simpler.</p>

<p>When they prepare for an assault the first line of
trenches is filled with men. At the command they climb
over the side and charge. Some run faster than others.
This makes the onrushing edge of the mass of men thinner
than the main body and irregular. It is like the
tumbling crest of a white cap.</p>

<p>As these men charge the trenches are filled again.
As soon as they are ready the second crowd starts over.
Then the third, and the fourth and so on. There is no
attempt to take cover, because there is no cover. It is a
rush to get there. There is no regular formation. The
trench spews forth a swarm of fighting demons and they
come trampling and yelling across that terrible strip of
earth as fast as they can come.</p>

<p>After our artillery annihilated the attack it began to
shell their trenches. We knew that we would make a
counter attack. Some of us may have slept that night.
I didn't.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, when it was very cold and the
impassive stars blinked dimly and more dimly, the "taraffia"
was passed down the line. This is chiefly rum, and
it makes one feel, "Why wait any longer? Let's get up
and at them now." If it wasn't for this I think we would
go crazy in those last twenty minutes before the attack.</p>

<p>Our artillery ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>En avant, mes enfants! On les aura!</i>" shouted the
officers.</p>

<p>The first company mounted the side of the trench and
dashed forward. Most of them were dangling in the
barbed wire as we rushed past. The earth in front of
us seemed to be whipped into a seething mass. They
were sweeping low with their machine guns so as to hit
us in the legs and drop us. With a shot through the
stomach we might go on for minutes and maybe kill a
Prussian before we died. But a hit in the legs drops a
man and the artillery can blow him to pieces later, when
the assault has been repulsed.</p>

<p>It is a scientific war.</p>

<p>A few of the first company reached the Prussian
trenches before us. We clubbed and stabbed and slashed
with the long knives they had given to us. The legion
does not take any prisoners, because legionnaires are not
taken prisoners. The Boches feel that we have no business
in the war.</p>

<p>The trench was so narrow I could not use my bayonet,
so I used the knife. I do not know how long we had
been fighting, but the Boches cleared out. We tried to
get our squads together and prepare for what we knew
would be coming. The enemy simply had retired to their
second-line trenches to let their artillery turn upon us
in their first-line shelter. All morning they hammered
us, but we hung on, lying flat upon our bellies and clinging
to our mother, the earth, as if she would protect us.
Showers of dirt almost buried us alive. Sometimes bits
of metal found a soft billet, and there was one fewer
of us to withstand the attack that would come as surely as
death awaits us all.</p>

<p>Suddenly quiet struck us like a blow. The echo of
the guns had scarcely died away when we heard the twitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and whistling of birds that had survived the terrific
shocks of the explosions.</p>

<p>Then we heard a different sound. It was the yelling
of the Boches. They were coming! Some rushed
through the crooked communication trenches which we
had blocked a little bit with earth and stones. Others
swarmed over the top of the ground. Some seemed to
rise from beneath our very feet.</p>

<p>Have you ever kicked into an ant hill? If you have
you know how the Boches fell upon us. I saw some one
climb over the rim of the trench and run back toward the
French lines.</p>

<p>I followed him.</p>

<p>I could not feel my legs. I seemed to be flying. The
strumming of a machine gun broke upon my consciousness.
I leaped headlong into a shell hole. Dead men
were around me and wounded lay thrashing there. Other
men leaped on me and fell into the pit. We lay there
until the sound of the machine gun stopped, then we
started madly again for our own lines. A star shell burst
and merciless light made everything stand out with terrifying
plainness. It is cadaverous light, like that from
a mercury tube.</p>

<p>We plunged into another shell hole. When the rest
of the men came tearing past us we leaped out and followed
them. I am not proud of my conduct in my first
fight.</p>

<p>After this assault I gradually became accustomed to
the noise and shock of artillery fire. We could hear the
shells coming, passing over our heads and speeding away
in the distance. It is a strange fact that after a few
weeks of artillery fire one develops a sort of instinct
which distinguishes between a shell coming toward him
and one just sailing off somewhere else in space.</p>

<p>I got so that shells all around me did not bother me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
but let one come in my direction and this extra sense
seemed to know it, and I would be flat on the ground
before I had time to think about it.</p>

<p>It was at Belloy-en-Santerre, on the Somme, July 2,
1916, that I had a chance to ease my conscience for the
way I had acted as a green recruit. Everything was
made ready for an assault by our troops. The town had
been literally knocked to pieces.</p>

<p>There was a wide strip of terrain between the trenches
at this point, but all of us were by now accustomed to
feel the breath of death against our cheeks, and when
the big guns stopped roaring there came the familiar "<i>En
avant, mes enfants! On les aura!</i>" We leaped over
the parapets and tore across at them.</p>

<p>The artillery had made their first-line trenches almost
untenable. The only men left in them were the machine
gun operators in their heavily armored turrets and
they kept spraying devastation among our legs until some
of the boys got round behind and threw grenades into
the turrets. After that the machine guns were quiet.</p>

<p>We reorganized when we had reached the first defences.
I don't know how many of the boys were flattened
out against the ground behind us, but I do know
that several companies had to be consolidated to make
one.</p>

<p>Then we swarmed over to the next defence line and
stabbed and slashed and threw grenades. Parties of us
ran to the bombproofs and threw in everything explosive
that we had, and let me tell you that, all stories to the
contrary notwithstanding, I never knew of anybody going
down into a bombproof and being stabbed by Prussians
who said they were wounded and needed help, because
nobody ever goes into a bombproof to see until
they have thrown grenades in and all is quiet. It would
be foolish to do otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>As I have said before, it is a rotten war any way you
look at it.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;WHEN THE BOCHES THROW GAS BOMBS</p>

<p>Well, after the attack we held the first two lines of
trenches. When I went off duty after being on outpost
I simply lay down in the mud and mess of things and
slept. I waked up coughing and wracking as if my body
were going to burst.</p>

<p>The Boches had crept over and thrown gas bombs
among us. Some of the men were too far gone to get
out of it. Others had managed to get away. A few had
gas masks, and one of these put his arms under my
shoulders and dragged me with him to the rear. We all
should have had our masks, and nowadays a soldier found
without his is severely punished. I had mine then, but
it was under my blanket and I couldn't get to it quickly
enough.</p>

<p>They stuffed something under my nose, and it hurt almost
as much as the gas, but it brought me to, and I
was put in an ambulance. The body of it was filled with
wounded men, so I sat with my legs dangling over the
tailboard, propped up against a leather strap. The poor
fellows inside groaned and grunted with every bump of
the crazy vehicle. The road was pitted from shell-fire,
and I had to hang on for dear life to keep from being
thrown off.</p>

<p>Presently the Boches began shelling the road. They
were not purposely after the ambulances. They were
just shelling that road. If ambulances were there they
were likely to get hit.</p>

<p>I heard one coming. I knew she was headed toward
us, but there was no place to duck to. Right behind us
the road seemed suddenly to bow up like a steel band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
when the ends are sprung suddenly together. Then it
settled back. I was so stunned by the shock of the explosion
that I hardly felt anything else, but as the ambulance
careened onward I began to feel a pain in my
thigh. I put down my hand, and when I looked at it
it was red. I had been hit.</p>

<p>A man lying on his back in the ambulance, with his
feet beside me, had lost more than half of one of them
as a result of the same explosion. There wasn't time
to do anything for either of us. The driver went ahead
like mad and got us to a dressing station, where dozens
of men were waiting for treatment.</p>

<p>Some of them were serious. The surgeon looked at
me and said, "You're easy. Can't waste much time on
you. Lie on that table."</p>

<p>I lay down on my stomach and he probed for a second,
then gave a yank. I thought he had pulled my leg
out by the roots, but he thrust a pair of pincers in front
of my eyes and said, "There it is. Want it?" and he
dropped a bit of shell into my hand. I still have it.</p>

<p>Then a big ambulance, with seven other men in it,
took me to Compiègne, where I lay in the dining saloon
of a château for a few hours and then was sent to Paris.</p>

<p>The wound healed quickly and I was sent back to the
trenches, but the gas had left my lungs bad, and I
couldn't stand the cold and wet. It wasn't long before
they invalided me out.</p>

<p>But I'm all right now, and I'm going back if they'll
let me.</p>


<p>V&mdash;THE BOYS WHO ARE "GONE" FOREVER</p>

<p>A lot of the boys I knew in the legion are gone now.
While I was in the hospital some of them got theirs. For
instance, there was Allan Seeger. It was reported not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
long ago that he killed himself while lying in a shell
hole, wounded. I don't believe that. I knew Seeger well,
and it doesn't sound like him.</p>

<p>He enjoyed a close, strange friendship with a negro
from the Barbadoes, whom we called Cafe-au-Lait because
he was the color of coffee more than half milk.
Cafe-au-Lait had Seeger's watch when I returned to the
trenches, and he was in the shell hole with him when he
lay there wounded. He had been shot through the stomach
and some stretcher-bearers rescued him. He was
put in an ambulance and sent to the rear, but he died before
they could get him to a hospital, according to Cafe-au-Lait,
who mourned his loss pitifully.</p>

<p>Then there was Christopher Charles, a dancer from
New York, whom you'd never take for a fighter, but
who could show the way to most of us. Another New
York man in the legion was "Norri" Norritch. He was
killed at Belloy-en-Santerre after they took me away
with my lungs full of gas. They said he had made hundreds
of thousands of dollars in New York real estate.</p>

<p>There was one Briton in the legion whose name was
Longman. He had been discharged from the British
army because he went to pieces after a girl had turned
him down. His one idea was to get killed. He was always
the first man over the top for an assault, and he
never bothered about taking shelter from shell fire unless
he was dragged into it. But he couldn't get hit.</p>

<p>Longman was reinstated in the British army for heroism
and sent down to the Balkans. Newspapers all over
the world have told his story. He went through the Serbian
campaigns with all the fever, typhus and pestilence
raging through the camps, and it never touched him. He
wooed death and she passed him by.</p>

<p>Then the Turks took him prisoner. They never would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
have done it had he known. Something knocked him
on the head, and when he waked up he was in a Turkish
hospital.</p>

<p>It would be hard to find a more conglomerate body of
men than the legion. Spaniards, Italians, Greeks, Poles,
who will not fight for Russia, but want to fight against
Prussia; Americans and British, shoulder to shoulder,
sharing blankets and little luxuries that filter into camp
from time to time.</p>

<p>In my company were a Spaniard and a Chilian who had
always been deadly enemies. The Spaniard had lost a
fortune gambling, and then the Chilian won the girl the
Spaniard was going to marry. They fought a duel, which
the police interrupted. Both joined the legion and were
assigned to the same squad.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;THE LEGIONAIRES IN THE BATTLE OF
MONTLUEL</p>

<p>The discipline is very strict in a way, but the legionnaires
have to be handled differently than any other
troops. They still delight to tell about what was dubbed
the "Battle of Montluel." Three pals from the legion
were in the town on leave. One was an American civil
engineer, one an Irishman of the school you read about&mdash;chivalrous,
humorous, always ready to fight&mdash;and the
third was an Englishman who had travelled so much that
he belonged nowhere in particular.</p>

<p>They drank all the good wine in Montluel and refused
to pay for any of it. At last they wandered into a tavern
they had missed and demanded something to drink.
The innkeeper refused them, having heard of their escapades.</p>

<p>The Irishman dashed at him. The proprietor floored
him with a chair. The two others leaped upon the innkeeper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Peasants and townsmen rushed in with flails,
sticks and anything handy and began beating the life out
of the three legionaires, who yelled for the gendarmes.
The gendarmes came, but they arrested the soldiers and
returned them to their military commander. They were
sentenced to twenty years of hard labor on the railroad
in Algeria.</p>

<p>But they begged so hard to be allowed to fight as long
as the war lasted that the commander agreed, saying they
deserved to be shot anyway.</p>

<p>I don't believe they will ever serve their twenty years
in prison, for if they are not killed they will have won
their pardon. Already they have won "citations" and
would have been decorated were they not technically prisoners.</p>

<p>I would just like to say one word about training men
for fighting in Europe. I don't want to presume to give
advice, but I fully believe that the only place to train
men for this kind of fighting is right behind the lines,
where they will hear the shells bursting. Then they can
be moved up to the reserve trenches and used for repair
and construction work until they are ready to be
put into the fighting.</p>

<p>In this war every man must take care of himself.
There has never been fighting like it. I don't care how
well trained a soldier may be, he has got to see something
of the war before he will be any good in a fight.</p>

<h2>SECRET STORIES OF THE GERMAN
SPY IN FRANCE</h2>

<p class="center"><i>How Sixty Thousand Spies Prepared for
the War</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have had a certain amount of experience of the German
spy and his devious ways, but in France&mdash;the first country that
the Huns had earmarked for destruction&mdash;the espionage system
was even more fully developed. Ever since the beginning of
the war the writer of this remarkable article has been engaged
in collecting authentic information concerning German spies
and their methods, and some of the results of his investigations
are set forth. A startling light is thrown on the ramifications
of a system that employed abroad more than sixty thousand
men and women in every walk of life, and which is still far
from having been eradicated.&mdash;Related in <i>Wide World Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF A STARTLING DISCOVERY AT
MONTE CARLO</p>

<p>In the early days of the war, when everything in the
military and civilian life of France was still in a state
of perturbation, certain undecipherable messages were
picked up nightly by the wireless telegraphy station at
Cros-de-Cagnes, a little fishing village on the French
Riviera, some seven miles from Nice. Other stations
in many other parts of the country and abroad likewise
received those mysterious fragments from the unknown&mdash;partly
in code, partly in unintelligible German&mdash;and
transmitted them to military headquarters, where futile
attempts were made to make head or tail of them. One
thing, however, was certain: they emanated from an
enemy source, a secret wireless installation somewhere, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the experts were convinced, either on the French or Italian
Riviera. The problem of the whereabouts of the German
or Austrian spies who thus dared to carry out their
nefarious operations under the very noses of the French
and Italian authorities at once became of intense interest
to the police all the way between Marseilles and
Genoa. But they searched for the culprits in vain.</p>

<p>Before the middle of August, 1914, however, thanks to
a perspicacious English journalist, the mystery was elucidated.</p>

<p>Singularly well-inspired, he had gone to Monte Carlo
to obtain war impressions. Had he searched all through
France he could not have found a more fruitful subject
for study than the little independent principality over
which the Prince of Monaco and M. Camille Blanc et
Cie. reign. For many years before the war the administrators
of the gambling hall had done everything in
their power to make Monte Carlo attractive to Germans
and Austrians, in order to fill the void left by English
visitors, a great many of whom had instinctively fled to
Egypt or elsewhere, to get away from these ill-mannered
or otherwise obnoxious guests. The Boches and their
accomplices having been expelled from the principality
on the second day of mobilization, our journalist found
the authorities of the Casino still staggering under the
blow which the cataclysm had dealt them. The Casino
was closed, the palaces and villas and hotels on the hillside
seemed to be sleeping more soundly than usual under
the hot August sun, the Terrace overlooking the sea was
deserted. Over everything was written, as it were, that
stock phrase of the croupiers&mdash;who now sat, armed with
fans in lieu of money-rakes, outside their own establishment&mdash;"<i>Rien
ne va plus.</i>"</p>

<p>With several pages of jottings in his notebook and his
brain filled with impressions, the journalist, who intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to take an early afternoon train back to Nice, turned, on
his way to the railway station, into the half-closed Café
de Paris. Here, getting into conversation with a communicative
<i>garçon</i>&mdash;a clearly well-informed Monagasque&mdash;he
unexpectedly gleaned the most important item of
intelligence he had yet come across, a piece of information
so curious and so significant that he there and then
decided to change his plans and spend the night at Monte
Carlo.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; it was high time they got rid of the Boches,"
said the waiter. "Monaco had become a veritable spies'
nest. At any rate, they got hold of one&mdash;Kurz, the
Austrian sub-director of the Casino. He was undoubtedly
working for Francis Joseph, otherwise how can one
explain the incriminating plans and documents which,
<i>on dit</i>, were seized at his house? They got him early
in the month, just after the Prince's notices to the Austro-Boches
were posted up, and he's now at the island
of Ste. Marguerite, where some others would be, too,
if they weren't being protected."</p>

<p>As he reached the end of this last phrase the waiter
lowered his voice to a confidential whisper, and after a
quick glance in the direction of the <i>caissière's</i> desk, in
order to assure himself that he was not observed, continued:</p>

<p>"The man with whom Kurz was naturally hand in
glove we've still in our midst, though I don't suppose
he'll have the face to stop here another twenty-four
hours. Vicht, the Director-General of the Casino, is
a German, and since the declaration of war he's done
all he could to get the authorities to maintain his too-recent
naturalization. He tries to make out he's a
Monagasque. <i>Mais cela ne marche pas.</i> The wonder
is that he's still here, for it's well known what he and
Kurz have been up to for years past. Everybody acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
with the position of affairs here knows that
these two men had at their disposition a small army of
detectives, whom they employed to shadow the <i>habitués</i>
of the Casino, including certain well-known journalists,
in order to ascertain the origin of information against
Germany and the Germans which had been published in
the press. Vicht and Kurz had become all-powerful
here, and would have turned the principality into a German
possession if they'd had the chance. They made
a start last winter, it is said, by assisting in the publication
of a German weekly newspaper run by an unsuspecting
journalist. Ah, Vicht's a wily customer&mdash;a man
to be watched, I think."</p>

<p>Thus put on the scent, the journalist decided, as I have
said, to postpone his departure and await developments,
which came much sooner than he expected.</p>

<p>Having dined at the Hôtel de Paris, he went out in the
cool of the summer evening to stroll on the Terrace and
smoke his cigar. It was a magnificent summer night,
one of those <i>soirées d'été</i> when Monte Carlo and Monaco,
with their soft-scented breezes from the hillsides and sea
and the twinkling lights in the little harbour opposite the
Condamine, were steeped in romance&mdash;a night for reflection.
Thoughts of the war and the astounding fact that
an enemy subject was still at liberty in the principality
filled the journalist's mind as, at the end of a quarter of
an hour's perambulation on the flower-adorned promenade,
he stopped to rest and, leaning on the parapet,
looked down on the harbour of the Bay of Hercules.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF THE MASTER SPY AND HIS
YACHT AT MONACO</p>

<p>A good-sized yacht was moored there. Whose was it?
It was not the <i>Princess Alice</i>, Prince Albert of Monaco's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
boat, which had been used for so many oceanographic
expeditions, and whose lines he knew well. Suddenly
he remembered to whom it belonged&mdash;to Jellineck, the
motor-car manufacturer, director of the Mercédès Company,
and Austrian Consul at Monaco, and the whole
story of that notorious spy's machinations flashed back
to his mind. Strange that he had not thought of it before,
when it was so recent!</p>

<p>Jellineck, an intimate friend of a French prefect of
the Alpes-Maritimes, whose sister, it is said, had once
been a governess to the children of the Austrian manufacturer,
had succeeded in escaping when war was declared,
and some of the blame had been laid by one of
the Nice newspapers on the shoulders of the French official.
Matters were made still worse when Jellineck's
yacht, which had been sequestrated and taken to Cannes,
was allowed, in most peculiar circumstances, to be removed
clandestinely to Monaco, where presumably, it
was in neutral waters. The affair created a great commotion
locally, because Jellineck's <i>rôle</i> as a master-spy
had long been suspected, a supposition supported by the
fact that a special messenger of his used to make the
journey every week from Nice to Ventimiglia, to receive
and dispatch his correspondence.</p>

<p>Whilst the journalist's eyes were fixed on the dark
outline of Jellineck's yacht, on board of which there
was not the slightest sign of life, his attention was attracted
by a strange luminosity playing, like a will-o'-the-wisp,
over the masts. By jove&mdash;wireless! To his observant
eye and well-trained technical mind there was not the
slightest doubt about it; that light could be nothing else
than radio-telegraphic sparks, the play of which can so
often be seen around the antennae of wireless telegraphy
stations.</p>

<p>This electric phenomenon furnished, as it were, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
missing link in a long chain of deductions which, subconsciously,
his brain had been turning over and over
days past&mdash;ever since, in fact, he had first heard from a
friendly police-inspector at Nice of the mysterious messages
picked up at Cros-de-Cagnes. The master-spy
Jellineck&mdash;the removal of his yacht to Monaco&mdash;wireless
messages dispatched or received there. With whom
was he still communicating? Surely it must be Vicht!</p>

<p>No further time to be lost. The journalist left the
Terrace immediately, walked swiftly down to the Condamine,
and took a short cut to the police-commissary's
office at Moneghetti. The little dark-eyed Italianesque
official acted with commendable promptness and circumspection.
Before the night was over two wireless installations
were seized&mdash;one on board Jellineck's yacht;
the other, traced in the same way, in a Monte Carlo
villa residence, which, if it had not actually been occupied
by Vicht or members of his family, had certainly
been rented by an accomplice, who, like himself, cleverly
managed to slip through the fingers of the police. The
flight of the Director-General of the Casino, first to
Ventimiglia, afterwards to San Remo, and then to Diana
Marina, coincided with the astute journalist's discovery&mdash;a
tell-tale fact indeed.</p>

<p>It has now been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt
that Monaco was, with Paris, Brussels, and Geneva,
one of the Germans' chief spy centres, and the operations
of their innumerable agents naturally spread to Nice,
Cannes, Toulon, and other places along the Riviera.
Even after Vicht's flight this dangerous man preserved
sufficient influence in the principality to obtain his salary,
which was brought to him from Ventimiglia, whilst
his accomplice, Kurz, had the impudence to write to the
gas company and order the gas to be laid on at his Monte
Carlo villa, presumably in view of his triumphal return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
there after the victory of the Germans! A German millionaire,
named Uhde, the owner of an important building
rented by a big bank, situated just beyond the frontier
line between Monaco and France, was arrested on
the day after mobilization, just as he was trying to escape
in his car. The owner of the chateau and estate of
Almanarre, near Hyères, Uhde, who was formerly an
officer in the Zieten Hussars, had chosen his property
with true military foresight. It enjoys an extensive view
over the Bay of Toulon, where he could follow at his
ease all the movements of the French warships. His suspicious
behaviour and frequent journeys to Germany led
to a lawsuit, some time before the war, between him and
M. Léon Daudet, whose <i>ante-bellum</i> revelations concerning
espionage in France have been shown to be in a great
measure correct. Uhde lost his action for libel before the
Toulon court, which condemned him to pay the costs, and
he met with little better results on appealing to Aix,
where, having claimed four hundred pounds damages,
he was awarded merely two pounds.</p>


<p>III&mdash;STORY OF THE MYSTERY OF THE
MOTOR BOAT RACES</p>

<p>The German and Austrian agents at Monte Carlo,
Nice, and elsewhere along the French Riviera hid their
plans so carefully that the observation of direct spying
was rare. Yet on other occasions than the one related
above, as testified by M. Georges Prade, they were caught
in the very act. The following striking instance came
to the notice of this well-known sportsman in April, 1914,
a few months before the war, when he was organizing
the motor-boat races at Monaco.</p>

<p>An extremely powerful motor-glider, with an engine
of four hundred horse-power, attained the enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
speed of sixty-two miles an hour in that year. Boat and
motor were built by M. Despujols, a Paris manufacturer,
and the glider was entered in the programme of events
as piloted by a Spaniard named Soriano. On the last
day of the races everybody heard with surprise that the
boat would not take part in the trials, as the motor had
already been taken to pieces and sent away. A little later
it transpired that a buyer, name unknown, had paid no
less than two thousand four hundred pounds for this
specialized motor, and, though it was utilizable only for
racing, had withdrawn it from the contest. The mystery
deepened when it was further learnt that the motor had
been sent first to Lyons, and thence to the well-known
electrical and dirigible manufacturing firm of Siemens-Schuckert,
at Biesdorf, near Berlin.</p>

<p>The whole truth came out in the course of an official
inquiry conducted by M. Prade, to whom M. Despujols
confided the details of the strange affair. The purchaser
was an individual named Schmidt, who pretended he was
a Russian, but who always steered German motor-boats
and raced under the German flag. He was to have competed
against M. Despujols' boat, but preferred to kill
two birds with one stone and buy him out. Working in
league with an engineer of the famous firm of Bosch, the
magneto manufacturers, who represented the German
house of Siemens, and with a workman who, although
he was known to be earning only two pounds a week,
was discovered to have distributed bank-notes very lavishly
in return for information, Schmidt learnt that the
motor in question was just what he was looking for.
Sent to Berlin at the end of April, 1914, it was destined
to form part of a curious motor-boat torpedo, filled with
explosives, running automatically, and controlled from a
distance by Hertzian waves. The value of such an engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
as this in a naval engagement, had it been brought to
perfection in all its parts, is self-evident.</p>

<p>Industrial espionage, of which this motor story is a
typical example, was practised on a very large scale at
Nice. The capital of the Riviera, where the Italian population
is very numerous, was regarded by the Germans
as one of the best centres for their operations when Italy
came into the war on the side of the Entente Powers.
Hence the completeness of their spy organization. Their
principal meeting-place was at the bookshop of Hohberg,
a vender of German "Kultur" in the Rue Maccarani.
Hohberg was the publisher of a paper called <i>Deutsche
in Nizza</i>, which had a circulation of twelve thousand
copies weekly and contained articles with such titles as
"In the Interests of Germanism." It heartily recommended
its readers to patronize the Reichsadler-Apotheke,
which masqueraded as an Anglo-Russian pharmacy,
or the notorious spy Hübner, a florist of the Rue
Masséna. It warmly upheld a campaign in favour of
Riviera sanatoriums&mdash;run by German or Austrian doctors&mdash;such
as the ones near Gorbio and Mentone, and
which were admirably suitable as hiding-places for German
officers, supposed to be convalescing but really spying.
It contained a complete list of German doctors,
tailors, etc., and frankly invited every Boche to pay a
call at the Nice office, which thus served as a central
organization for all the spies who, as tourists, naturalists,
botanists, <i>masseuses</i>, chiropodists, and quacks overran
that town and the whole of the beautiful Alpes-Maritimes.</p>

<p>"The man's topographical knowledge is extraordinary,"
said a Nice friend of mine one day, referring to a young
Austrian, the tutor to the children of Jellineck-Mercédés,
who used to spend every available holiday tramping
about the lavender-covered hills near Breil and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Franco-Italian frontier. "Although I've carried my
beehives from place to place in these parts during more
than twenty years, and pride myself on knowing every
inch of the ground, yet he has often astonished me by
his references to this or that mountain pathway or little-known
landmark. These Austrians and Germans, almost
without exception, possess a faculty for geographical
surveying, linked with a strange liking for pedestrianism
in the neighbourhood of frontiers and forts. Can that
be merely a coincidence?"</p>

<p>This was some years before the war, and at the time
my friend's declaration produced no more than a passing
impression. But I have since come to see what an important
truth and warning it contained, the very kernel
of the thesis which another clear thinker and Alsatian
patriot, the Abbé Wetterlé, developed with great skill
at the general meeting of the Touring Club de France on
December 5th, 1915.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;HOW EVERY GERMAN TOURIST BECAME
A SPY</p>

<p>The Abbé Wetterlé showed in his lecture how every
German, through his civil and military education, has
become a potential spy; how, on going forth to spend his
holidays in France or elsewhere abroad, he could not help
being the active agent of those directors of his conscience,
the Pan-Germanists.</p>

<p>"Recollect, everywhere and always, that you belong to
the supreme race," they said to him, through their newspapers,
pamphlets, and tracts. "Even if you know the
language of the country where you are travelling, speak
nothing but German. Never put up at any hotels but
those kept by Germans, and amongst these choose only
the ones kept by compatriots who you know have preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
all their attachment for the Fatherland. Insist
in these establishments that they serve you with German
products, and that the bill of fare is drawn up in your
native tongue. Drink only beer imported from Germany.
In the shops buy only those goods which bear the mark
'Made in Germany.' Praise wherever you go German
industry, German methods, German science. To keep
your feet on the right path, we will supply you with
guides, in which you will find every needful address.
Our good counsel will accompany you everywhere. And
thus, whilst amusing and instructing yourself, you will
render signal service to your country and will become a
pioneer of Germanism in those countries which we wish,
progressively, to dominate. Moreover, <i>never forget in
the course of your travels that you can make a thousand
useful observations. Note down what you see and send
us the information you collect.</i> Details apparently the
most insignificant may be of use to our industrial, commercial,
and patriotic societies. Finally, strengthen the
patriotic feeling with our compatriots established abroad.
Tell them that Germany does not forget them, and that it
is to their interest to remain in close relations with it. If
you act in this way&mdash;and you cannot do otherwise, for
we shall keep a sharp eye on you&mdash;you will contribute
largely to the glory of Germany, which to-morrow will
dominate the world."</p>

<p>This picture is in no way exaggerated. Identical language
was addressed to German tourists by the Pan-Germanist
Association and the Deutschtum im Ausland
Society, and the guides they published inculcated the
principles of the most barefaced espionage.</p>

<p>The information which these ambulatory amateur spies
collected was undoubtedly precious. It assisted in the
spread of German commerce and German ideas. Our
enemies worked on the principle that every little helped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and that the observations of a spectacled professor tramping
through France could be turned to almost as much
use as those of a professional spy, working under cover
of a bank or an insurance company like the Viktoria zu
Berlin in Paris, which our friends and Allies the French
very soon closed down. The sum-total of the efforts of
all these amateur and professional spies was enormous,
and would indeed have led to the domination of Europe
by the Teuton but for his inborn crass stupidity.</p>

<p>I wonder when we shall really learn to know the true
character of the German? French people, who long ago
put a stop to Teuton tricks, are amazed to hear that we
still allow the enemy to remain in our midst, and that we
actually help them to carry on their businesses, just as
though the war never existed. "Are you aware of the
fact," I have often been asked by Parisian friends, "that
these large German concerns were nothing more or less
than gigantic spying organizations?"</p>


<p>V&mdash;REVELATIONS OF THE SPY SYSTEM</p>

<p>Those who have any doubt about this should read the
remarkable revelations of M. Georges Prade anent the
Viktoria zu Berlin Insurance Company, the premiums of
which represented over eighty million pounds. In the
Paris offices of this company, in the Avenue de l'Opéra,
M. Prade discovered a peculiar organization called the
Special Büro. The <i>employés</i> of this office were all Germans,
between twenty-five and thirty years of age, and
officers in the German reserve. They spent from five to
six months in France, received forty pounds a month
each, with an allowance for travelling expenses, and spent
their time motoring all over France. Eastern France
and the Alps was their favourite region. Naturally they
all disappeared a few days before the German mobilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
in July, 1914. Whilst these men were spying out
the land, their colleagues in Paris were performing
equally useful work for the German Government, "establishing
an exact estimate of the public fortune, a useful
element in assessing war taxation and indemnities," and
otherwise obtaining valuable information. The Viktoria,
for example, offered special terms to French officers. It
insured them, without extra charge, against war risks,
and, through the medium of visiting agents, advanced
money at very reasonable terms on their policies. The
Berlin offices of the Viktoria thus secured the names of
all the French officers who owed it money, an excellent
arrangement indeed on which to base an organization for
spying.</p>

<p>One of the most astounding institutions in Paris before
the war was a free German school, open to children of all
nationalities, where instruction was given entirely in German,
and French was treated as a foreign tongue. Naturally
history and geography were taught from the German
standpoint, and a love of Germany and the Kaiser
was dinned into the pupils. Stranger still, none of the
professors held a French certificate, a <i>sine qua non</i> for a
French teacher, or were even naturalized. Yet in 1908
one of them was even decorated with the Legion of
Honour.</p>

<p>Side by side with this instance of "peaceful penetration"
may be placed that of a commercial agency, the
Agence Schimmelpfeng, which existed in Paris for years,
and, under the guise of a society for giving confidential
information to commercial houses and their customers,
covered a most elaborate and minute spy system, with
central offices in Berlin. To give but one example of the
work of this agency, it knew the name of every baker in
the East of France, how many men he employed, and the
exact number of sacks of flour he used per week. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the German military authorities knew almost to a loaf
how much bread could be counted on for an invading
army.</p>

<p>German spies were always particularly active in Eastern
France. Another precaution they took was to secure
all the contracts for coal for the frontier forts, in order
to be able to withhold supplies at a critical moment and
thus render them useless. On a par with this was the
establishment of a German chemical works adjoining an
airship factory, which they were ready to supply with
hydrogen just as long as it suited them. The arrangement
had this additional advantage: when any little hitch
occurred with a machine, German workmen were always
ready with their help. A French dirigible had thus no
secrets for them.</p>

<p>Supplies and the methods by which as complete a control
of them as possible could be obtained must have
been made the study of a special section of the Secret
Service department in Berlin. It is not curious that in
1912 a German firm should have succeeded in obtaining
the contract for the exclusive furnishing of lubricating
oil for the French army motor-cars? But this is nothing
in comparison with the plans laid for getting possession
of the iron-fields of Normandy and a certain part of the
French Channel coast.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;STORY OF A "GERMAN GIBRALTAR" IN
NORMANDY</p>

<p>Germany, lacking iron ore, obtained extensive concessions
of land in Normandy and annually sent vast quantities
of mineral to Krupp's, where it went to the making
of munitions to be used against the Allies. In the extraction
of this ore only German machinery, worked by
German coal, was used. Simultaneously our arch-enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
got possession of a place called Diélette, eighteen miles
west of Cherbourg, and constructed there a deep-water
port, capable of accommodating vessels of fifty thousand
tons. The ostensible purpose set forth by the <i>concessionnaires</i>
was the shipping of ore and the working of a
submarine iron-mine, but the real object was made clear
when the German newspapers, in their bragging way,
began to write about Diélette as the "German Gibraltar."
And a German Gibraltar it would have become but for
Great Britain's intervention in the war. For if France
had not had our Navy behind her, nothing would have
been easier than to land German troops at Diélette. The
port and arsenal of Cherbourg would have been but a
mouthful for the Huns, the western side of Cherbourg,
owing to the natural disposition of the land, being undefended,
as it has always been looked upon as impregnable.
And so it was until the port of Diélette was constructed.</p>

<p>Diélette, the proposed German submarine base for the
Channel, and adapted not only for military and naval
purposes, but most conveniently situated for spying on
Cherbourg, was used for the first time as a port only a
week before the outbreak of war. On July 25th, 1914,
the first big vessel arrived and was loaded in the record
time of twenty-four hours. Under the superintendence
of Raders, the chief spy, large quantities of explosives
had been accumulated. The greater part was seized by
the French Government, but when the authorities attempted
to visit the mine it was discovered that many of
the galleries had been wilfully flooded.</p>

<p>After all the arrangements had been made at Diélette,
the Germans began to say that the carriage of iron ore
thence to a German port had been found to be too costly,
so they immediately began to acquire land and make arrangements
for smelting on the spot. Furnaces were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
built at Caen, a railway line was constructed, the canal
from that town to the sea was deepened, and things were
so arranged that at any given moment Caen could be
cut off from its natural port, Ouistreham. The electric
cable transmitting the motive force for this port and for
the opening and shutting of the bridges over the canal
was aerial, and passed over land acquired by another of
the prime movers of the Diélette and Caen schemes, a
man named Thyssen, an intimate friend of the Kaiser.
This cable was cut on August 12th, 1914.</p>

<p>The machinery and materials, directors and workmen
of all these undertakings were German, so that, although
some of the capital of the company was furnished by
French shareholders, practically the whole of this part of
Normandy was already, when war broke out, in the hands
of the Huns. Normandy in their power, they set about
getting Brittany. Private individuals bought up large
tracts of land and islands, and there is no doubt that the
splendid port of Brest would before long have been
theirs. Was not one of the Kaiser's sons familiarly
known in Berlin as the "Duke of Brittany?"</p>

<p>I have mentioned two of the chief spies connected with
the Normandy plots, Raders and Thyssen. The former
left the mine at Diélette on August 1st, but was arrested.
Hefter, one of his subordinates, received a telegram that
his brother had been run over by a train, and so got away
on July 26th, whilst a third, a so-called Swiss, named
Strobel, stayed in France for a month, and even returned
to Diélette in January to destroy a trunk full of papers
in a house which he had occupied.</p>

<p>Rheims, the cathedral city of saddened memories, was
another of the great spy centres of France. More than
seventy inhabitants, in every imaginable disguise, had to
be shot, we are told by M. Léon Daudet, who before
and since the war has thrown much light on German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
espionage. Every woollen mill in Rheims was known
to the enemy, and at the time of the invasion they sent
off to Germany more than a hundred wagon-loads of
models and drawings of machines, and so on, together
with multitudinous bales of merchandise. All account-books
were soaked with paraffin and burnt, and all workmen's
dwellings were systematically destroyed.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that as regards works, factories, and
mills of all kinds, a systematic plan was followed wherever
the German system of espionage operated. Those
that could in any way be useful to the invaders during
their occupation were carefully preserved, and those
judged prejudicial to their future commercial prosperity
were as ruthlessly destroyed. It was the same with private
residences. Anything belonging to spies&mdash;many of
them naturalized Frenchmen&mdash;was marked by advance
guards in accordance with a carefully-prepared list, and
was neither burnt nor pillaged when all around was
destroyed.</p>

<p>Henkell, of Wiesbaden, had some years ago started a
wine business at Rheims, and his warehouse was built
between the barracks, the aviation ground, the military
fodder stores, and other official buildings. From the
windows of his establishment he and his <i>employés</i> could
keep an eye on the movement of all military trains on
the three lines leading from Rheims to Chalons, Charleville,
and Laon.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;STORY OF HERMANN VON MUMM,
"PRINCE OF CHAMPAGNE"</p>

<p>But this man Henkell was a mere underling compared
with others. Hermann von Mumm, of champagne fame,
was the high priest of the spies of Rheims. A multimillionaire,
he owned a splendid residence in that city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
another in the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne in Paris, and
a third in the Department of the Marne. He was served
by a retinue of servants, most of whom were non-commissioned
officers in the German army. Besides being
an enthusiastic motorist, he kept a racing stable. Many
German officers visited and stayed with him. Under
cover of his wine business, the acquiring of vineyards
or other land, these spies openly scoured the country
until they knew it in its minutest details. Everything
was thus foreseen and arranged for the German occupation&mdash;the
position of trenches, good shelters, cemented
platforms for heavy guns, and even stores of ammunition
in disused quarries. It was entirely due to Mumm
and his satellites that the Huns were able to establish
themselves in Champagne so firmly. After the victory
he was to have been Prince of Champagne.</p>

<p>Thanks to Hermann von Mumm's horse-dealings and
the sumptuous fétes he was accustomed to give, he succeeded
in establishing relations with innumerable people
willing to uphold and help him in his nefarious work. At
Chantilly, the racing centre, he had quite a little army of
spies under his direction.</p>

<p>His brother, Walter von Mumm, a devotee of shooting,
who with his friends was responsible for about four
thousand head of game every year at Ville-aux-Bois,
went to Germany in February, 1914, and on his return
informed his keepers that he should preserve no game
that year, <i>as he did not intend to shoot next season</i>. On
July 25th, 1914, he left in one of his motor-cars, with
his French chauffeur, for Frankfort, telling his servants
he should be back in three weeks' time, between August
15th and 25th. Once over the frontier the chauffeur was
astonished to see numbers of soldiers on the march, and
was calmly informed by his master that it was "<i>la
guerre</i>." On reaching Frankfort he was dismissed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
told to get back to France as best he could, which he did
after a long and painful journey <i>viâ</i> Belgium.</p>

<p>In the district known as La Woevre, a great plain in
the east, extending between the Meuse and the Moselle,
all the large farms for years past gradually slipped into
the hands of the Germans, who generally bought them
much above their value, and then, as often as not, let
them lie fallow. All the labourers were Germans, mostly
not speaking French, whilst many others appeared to be
much above their station&mdash;evidently spies who would be
most useful to an invading army as knowing all the strategic
points, pathways, bogs, and so on.</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF A SECRET TELEPHONE
SYSTEM</p>

<p>Much the same thing happened around Verdun. Many
of these frontier towns had secret telephones installed in
the cellars. A French ambulance worker, taken prisoner,
was conducted into one of these farms to await the convoy
she was to join. By accident she was hustled into a
room full of telephonic apparatus, and was able, before
she was hurriedly taken away again, to read the names
of some twenty French villages inscribed over them. She
had encountered by chance the central exchange of the
spy farms.</p>

<p>In this manner did the Huns lay their plans for the
hoped-for occupation of France. When the time came
for the declaration of the war the majority of the spies
of Germany made good their escape. But some, in accordance
with the orders of their superiors, remained
behind to continue to assist in the conquest of the
country.</p>

<p>When the German army was marching towards Paris
signals were noticed at night on the heights of Meudon-Bellevue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and these were answered by others along the
river. Similar ones were noticed near the Gare du Nord
and the Gare de l'Est, and it is a fact that at no matter
what hour a train of stores left the former station bombs
were always dropped upon it. This continued, I have
been told by a person in authority, until certain spies,
who had obtained employment with the railway company
in order to signal the departure of the trains, were discovered
and shot.</p>

<p>I have often been asked if I think that much spying
still goes on, even in this third year of the war, and my
invariable reply is, "Read the newspapers." Hardly a
day passes without a case of espionage being recorded in
the Press. Here are two typical examples which have
come to my own particular notice quite recently.</p>

<p>The first is that of a certain Marie Liebendall, wife
of Gimeno Sanches, born at Düsseldorf and twenty-eight
years of age. Accused of espionage, she was sentenced
to death by the Council of War of the Fifteenth Region.
She gave herself out to be a countess, but in reality is
the daughter of the manager of the Mannesmann works
at Munich. After residing in Germany and the United
States, she came to France, under the cloak of her Spanish
husband, and devoted herself to spying. She was
arrested at Cerbère, at the very moment she was escaping
into Spain. Imprisoned at Marseilles, she attempted
to poison herself.</p>

<p>The second case is that of Frido J. C. von Meyerem,
who was sentenced to death on September 6th last by
the First Court-Martial in Paris and then tried again in
November by the Third Court-Martial, the first sentence
having been quashed owing to a technical fault in the
procedure. Meyerem was accused of concealing his German
nationality at Nice in March, 1916, and also of entering
the entrenched camp of Paris in the same month.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
While at Nice he corresponded in invisible ink with an
espionage agent, who sent him a cheque for about forty
pounds. He was also charged with having furnished the
enemy with information prejudicial to the operations of
the army and compromising the security of the forts and
other military establishments. Meyerem was again adjudged
guilty and sentenced to death.</p>

<p>Thousands of these men and women, ready to risk
their lives for the love of money and the German Fatherland,
undoubtedly continue their dangerous work all
over France to-day. The majority of them are women,
either the German wives of French subjects or alleged
"neutrals." They are thus free to go about under the
protection of their borrowed or neutral flag, without let
or hindrance. Some who are unmarried play, I am convinced,
a more hazardous game by remaining in hiding
until night, when they come forth like nocturnal birds of
prey. This is by no means so difficult in a large city
like Paris as one would think, as witness the case of an
Austrian, Michel Augmeister, aged thirty-eight, a native
of Martensdorf, who remained hidden away by his
French wife in his apartment at 24, Rue Brey, for no less
than twenty-six months. It was not until October 25th
last that, as his health was suffering seriously from seclusion,
his spouse considered it the wisest plan to give him
up to the police.</p>


<p>IX&mdash;EXPOSURE OF THE "LONELY SOLDIER"
TRICK</p>

<p>Among the multitudinous means employed by German
female agents in France is the insertion of small advertisements
in the Parisian papers proposing an exchange
of correspondence with British officers at the Front. Until
a stop was recently put to this practice, as the result
of an inquiry at military headquarters, I frequently saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
advertisements of this sort in a daily published in Paris.
Here is a specimen of one announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Refined Parisian lady wishes to exchange correspondence
with cultured person at the Front, to improve
knowledge."</p>

<p>A few days later the same advertiser varied the wording
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Young Parisian widow, having greatly travelled,
wants to exchange correspondence with cultured officer
at the Front."</p>

<p>In a series of similar advertisements she became "an
artist," "an actress," and "an independent lady." That a
large number of "lonely" British officers were deceived
and entered into correspondence with her is certain. It
is satisfactory to be able to say that, through the vigilance
of the authorities, she did not succeed in her object. A
certain foolish young lieutenant had a narrow escape from
falling into her clutches. He wrote&mdash;quite in good faith&mdash;that
he would be glad not only to correspond, but also
to meet her when he next came to Paris with his colonel,
as he fairly frequently came to the capital, and put up
at the Hôtel Continental. However, very fortunately for
him, the meeting never came off, for before the letter
had reached its destination the lady had received her
warning and sailed for the United States.</p>


<p>X&mdash;TALES OF THE SPIES AT THE FRONT</p>

<p>Mr. W. Beach Thomas, the <i>Daily Mail</i> correspondent
with the British Army, recounted on October 19th last a
strange incident which occurred at Armentières, where
the old and more regular method of warfare then prevailed.
"Two days ago," he wrote, "a civilian was seen to
leap over the parapet of our front trench and run for the
German line, which is not far distant. He was shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
dead before reaching it, <i>and in the evening the Germans
recovered his body</i>. How had he reached our trench?
Who was he? Was he spy or madman?" Few readers
will hesitate over the answer.</p>

<p>There must indeed be numerous spies at the Front. I
am told that in certain sectors the country people whose
homes are still within the war area are frequently suspected,
and wonder has often been expressed that the
military authorities have not long ago ordered them to
retire far to the rear.</p>

<p>I have heard of a ploughman who, for the guidance of
Hun airmen, ploughed two converging furrows pointing
directly to the position of a concealed battery, which was
later severely shelled, and of a seemingly unsophisticated
countrywoman who laid out a white sheet on the ground,
wherein to pack her wares for market, hard by another
important position that German planes were searching
for. Both these people turned out to be disguised Boche
agents.</p>

<p>The liberty of the <i>mercantis</i>, or itinerant merchants,
who infest the rear and rob the French <i>poilu</i> or British
"Tommy" by selling him wretched goods at an exorbitant
price should likewise be curtailed.</p>

<p>Spies are to be divided into innumerable categories.
Within the limits of a magazine article it is impossible to
do more than touch on the fringe of this great topic.
One could devote two or three chapters of a book merely
to the subject of those spies who, from time to time, are
carried at night-time within the French and British lines
by German airmen, who pick them up again when dawn
is about to break. This is the most perilous game which
the spy is called upon to play. It leads to the most extraordinary
adventures and hairbreadth escapes, and
some of these I hope later on to have the opportunity of
relating.</p>

<h2>HOW STRONG MEN DIE&mdash;TALES
OF THE WOUNDED</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Experiences of a Scottish Minister</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Rev. Lauchlan Maclean Watt, Minister of
St. Stephen's, Edinburgh</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The courage of the Scots is one of the epics of the Great War.
An insight into their strong character may be seen by this
minister's story to <i>The Scotsman</i>, revealing the pathos and fortitude
of men on their death-beds.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE MINISTER AT THE
DEATH-BED</p>

<p>It is truly a great thing to see that the day of willing
devotion to the noblest ideals is not yet gone from the
life of our people. Suffering and death are faced without
repining, and men say farewell to the promise of
their youth ungrudgingly, feeling that the investment for
the sake of the future of the world is worth the cost
which they are paying. To the greatest life and death
are very simple alternatives, lying easily to either hand,
accepted without complaining.</p>

<p>One day I was going through a tent of suffering men
just after a big "stunt." It was a day of much and great
agony for those who were in actual bodily pain and for
those of us who had to try to help them to endure it.
I saw two men carried in and laid on beds side by side
with each other. One was obviously very severely
wounded. The other was swathed in bandages over his
head and down over his face, apparently blinded. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
a moment I hesitated, thinking it might be better to come
back when, perhaps, the agonies of the one might be
somewhat abated. But I put my hesitation aside. I
found that the two men were brothers who, fighting in
the same trench, had been struck down by the same shell.
Late that evening an ambulance came for me as a man
was dying, and I found it was the soldier I had spoken
to earlier in the day.</p>

<p>The camp lay beautifully still, for the clouds were
heavy and the stars were veiled. I stepped into the tent,
into the breathing dark. The beds were swathed in
shadow, only one red lamp hanging from a central post.</p>

<p>They had brought the brothers quite closely together,
and the man with the bandaged eyes had a hand of the
other in his own. The dying man took mine in a grip
of ice.</p>

<p>"Padre," he whispered, "I am going home. And I
wanted you to come again to me. Write tenderly to my
people. This will break their hearts. And pray that
my brother may be spared." There is no ritual for a
moment like that. One could but ask Him who was
broken also for others to be near this broken man whose
body was pierced unto dying for the sake of those he
loved. We whispered together there a few lines of
"Jesus, Lover of My Soul," and a verse of the immortally
wonderful "Lead, Kindly Light." And then he put
his arm about my neck and drew me closer.</p>

<p>"I tried to do what was right," said he. "O Christ,
receive my soul. Have mercy upon me." I heard a
man near me, in the dark, say "Amen." And I knew
the fellows were not sleeping. They were lying there,
in their own pain, thinking of him who was passing that
night into the great beyond. Then I said, very quietly,
the last verse of the hymn he had whispered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
So long Thy power hath blessed me, sure it still<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Will lead me on,</span><br />
O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">The night is gone,</span><br />
And with the morn those angel faces smile<br />
Which I have loved long since and lost a while.<br />
</div>

<p>The silence lay between us for a little, till the dying
man asked, "What o'clock is it?" And I told him.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry for disturbing you so late," said he.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, padre, till we meet again." And with a
sigh he passed away.</p>

<p>I heard a quiet step near me, and I looked around,
with the dead man in my arms. I should not have been
astonished if I had seen the very Christ, with His wounds
shining there, behind me, in that quiet tent, now so terribly,
infinitely still. It was only the woman with the
red cross on her breast, the angel of the sick and weary
in their pain, seeming always to us, in such a moment,
the nearest we can get to Christ, for tenderness and help.
And so I laid the dead man down upon his pillow; and
had to turn immediately to the living one to comfort him.</p>


<p>II&mdash;LIFT YOUR HAT TO THE RED CROSS</p>

<p>As long as I live I shall lift my hat to the red cross.
It is, of course, the symbol of the highest sacrifice earth's
history ever knew; and it is still the mark of the tenderest
devotion and most perfect self-surrender for the sake
of others. Every man in khaki, and every man that has
a soldier boy to love, should salute that symbol which
speaks of love amid the hate and turmoil of war. For it
means womanhood consecrated to gentle service, reckoning
neither wage nor worry in aught it does, and it takes
the sting from broken manhood that has ventured for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
the sake of honour and of duty, through comradeship in
suffering, to the verge of life, and beyond it.</p>

<p>War takes a man in the splendid vigour of his full
manhood and flings him out of trench and battlefield a
bleeding thing. The devoted women of the hospital tent
shrink from no duty when the suffering and mire-stained
man is brought to them. There can be no greater self-mastery
and no more sublime self-forgetfulness than the
washing of the bodies of the stricken and the dressing
of the terrible wounds that have broken their murderous
way into the fair flesh of the soul's house. And how
they work! It has to be seen to be understood, and once
seen it can never be forgotten. Faithfulness, tenderness,
and loving devotion are the marks of those ministering
angels, "when pain and anguish wring the brow." There
is no question of adherence to hours. It becomes a
question of adherence to duty when a rush is on. There
is no strike for shorter hours, or an increased wage,
or a war bonus with them or the brave men whom they
serve. The men, even to the roughest "grouser," appreciate
it fully. "O sister! go to rest now," I have heard
them say, pleadingly, to the tired woman with the red
cross on her breast and the white cross in her heart.</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE LADS WHO DRIVE THE AMBULANCE
CARS</p>

<p>So, also with the lads who drive the ambulance cars.
I have felt my heart fill as I watched them bringing in
the wounded. Gently as a mother carrying a sick child
in her bosom, they creep with their agonized burdens
over the rough roads, calculating every inequality, thinking
through every stage of the journey. I remember,
at midnight, standing by one that had just been brought
in. The first to be lifted out on a stretcher was a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
fellow, an Irishman, with his right arm blown off. The
doctor, with his lantern, leaned over and asked his name.</p>

<p>But the suffering man looked up in his face and said,
"Sir, before we do anything, please thank the driver.
He's a Christian and a gentleman."</p>

<p>The common sorrow of the allied nations binds them
very tenderly together. I used to see a fine expression
of this in the town where I was first stationed, where
some women who had a garden, on the way to the cemetery,
were wont to do a very beautiful thing. As, almost
daily, the heavy lumbering wagons with the dead
came rolling along, those kindly hearts came out and laid
on each coffin, above the Union Jack, a bouquet of exquisite
flowers. Then the wagons rumbled on toward
the graves. It was a sweet tribute to the brave strangers
who are fighting in France, so many of them giving their
all in sacrifice for liberty, love, and home in this hideous
uprising of all that was monstrous in the dark ages that
are past.</p>

<p>One perhaps learns most by unlearning. I used to
think of the spirit of pain as intensely, even immensely,
vocal. I remember, especially, when I was young, a
great gully in the north, beside the sea, up which the
waves came dashing in perpetually recurrent warfare, the
flood seeking ever higher, only to be drawn away down
the sloping shingle again, shrieking, to the main. Often
in the daytime I would listen, and, in the dark, would
linger near, held by the awe of the unsleeping tragedy
of that vast elemental grief which sways about the edges
of the world. I told my heart, "This is the spirit of the
world pain finding voice." But now I know otherwise.
I have learned better in the school of suffering, in the
land of war. The spirit of pain is silent&mdash;tholing, at its
deepest. It looks at you out of those suffering eyes.
There is no cry in it. For the mystery of duty is within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
its depths. The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah is its truest
picture. So it comes to be that the nobility and manliness
of the brave combine, with unforgettable splendour
of ineffable beauty, the darkness of our times.
When they do speak there is a majesty of stillness about
their utterance, vast as the mid-deep, far away, out under
the stars.</p>

<p>The lads are uplifted by the nearness of the Unseen.
I have before me two genuine documents, letters of two
fine boys who went godward up the highway of the
sun&mdash;the way of sacrifice. They speak for themselves.
No novelist's imagination could create so fine an utterance.
One was scribbled in the trenches, the other in the
hospital ward, to those who had the best claim on the
best the writers had to give. Said one:</p>

<p>"I am in the trenches, and in half an hour we go over
the top. Our artillery is going at it hammer and tongs,
the biggest bombardment in English history. It is just
like huge express trains rushing through the air in hundreds.
All of us are happy in the prospect of a clean
fight after so many weary months as passive spectators
of anything but warfare, except on rare occasions. If I
get through all right I shall add a postscript to this.
If not, mother dear, I know you will not be beaten by a
Spartan mother who had no heavenly Father revealed to
her to look to for comfort, but yet could say, 'Come
back with victory, or not at all.' With heaps of
love. * * *"</p>

<p>The other is suffused with the same straightforward
spirit of fearlessness and faith.</p>

<p>"I was so glad to see your answer this morning, but
am sorry I have not enough strength to write much. A
good few died of wounds in this hospital through weakness,
but I am leaving all doubts with God, as He holds
the key of all the Unknown, and I am glad. So if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
die before long, and I cannot see anything more sure, I
hope to meet you all in God's good time. My wound is
numb. It is in my thigh, and I have no pain. * * *
I am now at the balance, to live or die. So good day,
and God bless all. * * *"</p>

<p>There was nothing really extraordinary about these
boys among their fellows. But one is struck by the frequency
with which the men, after a deep emotion, touch
literature in their letters. Of course the secret of true
style lies in a real experience. Some of them, it is true,
tell absolutely false tales, and their letters are sentimental
poses. But of the letters of dying men there can
be no mistake, and these boys wrote these on the threshold
of the eternal mystery. They are types of a large
proportion of the army of to-day, fighting, suffering, and
dying as those who have looked in the face of the Invisible,
and are inheriting the promise, "Be thou faithful
unto death and I will give thee a crown of life." It is
surely an incentive to the people at home, for honour and
remembrance.</p>

<h2>THROUGH THE JAWS OF DEATH IN
A SUNKEN SUBMARINE</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Emile Vedel in L'Illustration, Paris</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Many a novelist and some dramatists have tried to imagine the
last agonies of the crew of a submarine boat that has received
a mortal wound and sunk. Here is a first-hand account of the
dreadful reality, told by men who actually experienced the
tragedy. How these men slipped out from the very jaws of
death just as they were closing on them, even they cannot fully
explain; but some strange freak of the machinery made their
submarine bob back to the surface after the water pouring into
it had sent the vessel down 200 feet. Emile Vedel, who is
writing the story of the French naval operations in the Adriatic
and publishing it serially, under governmental authority in
<i>L'Illustration</i>, obtained the facts from the signed statements of
two petty officers of the boat. Translated by Arthur Benington
in the <i>New York World</i>. Copyright, 1917, Press Publishing
Company.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE PRISONERS IN BOHEMIA</p>

<p>A composite flotilla of French, British and Italian
gunboats and submarines attacked an Austrian flotilla
which had sneaked out from the Bocche di Cattaro, on
the eastern shore of the Adriatic and shelled the port of
Durazzo. The engagement resulted in the sinking of an
Austrian destroyer. The following day the French picked
up some sailors from another Austrian destroyer, the
<i>Llka</i>, which had struck a mine and sunk. These sailors
told them that in attacking the Austrian fleet the Allied
boats had narrowly escaped killing the survivors of a
French submarine that had been sunk and the crew of
which had been rescued by Austrian gunboats.</p>

<p>What submarine it was they were at a loss to know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
but as time passed and nothing was heard from the
<i>Monge</i>, they became convinced that it must have been
she. This conviction was strengthened two months later,
when Mme. Roland Morillot, wife of Lieut. Morillot,
commander of that boat, received a letter signed "Crew
of the <i>Monge</i>," mailed from the concentration camp for
prisoners at Deutsch Gabel, Bohemia, of which the following
is a translation of a part:</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the distance, we unite our grief with
yours in weeping over the memory of him who in spite of
all will ever remain our captain. Stricken by a blow of
fate just when victory smiled most brightly, Commandant
Morillot died like a hero, after having accomplished the
almost impossible to save his vessel and his crew."</p>

<p>More months elapsed; then Chief Master Electrician
Joffry and Quartermaster Mahe, both of the <i>Monge</i>,
were returned to France from Austria in an exchange of
prisoners. And they told the story.</p>


<p>II&mdash;STORY OF A COLLISION AT 30 KNOTS</p>

<p>The <i>Monge</i> belonged to the class of submarines that
have to use a steam engine for recharging their diving
accumulators. It had been scouting ahead of the rest of
the flotilla and had crept close to the Bocche di Cattaro
that night when the Austrian fleet came out. At 12.15
A. M. Commandant Morillot sighted the lights of the
Austrian vessels. How many he couldn't tell, nor how
far away they were. He submerged to 20 feet, leaving
the night periscope above the surface. Suddenly he was
aware of a rapidly approaching huge black mass, and
was giving orders to fire a torpedo from the port tube
when a hitherto unseen vessel passed at 30 knots right
over the <i>Monge</i>. Its keel struck the submarine; the
shock was terrific. The little boat rolled almost over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
The conning tower was smashed and the sea poured in
through a gaping hole.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Monge</i> tumbled in heaps against the
partitions of the compartments in which they happened
to be. The stern dropped, the bows rose, and the boat
began sinking stern foremost at an angle of 30 or 40 degrees.
Abominable gases rose as the sea water flooded
the tanks of sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>The electric lights went out. The <i>Monge</i> wabbled
downwards in pitch darkness.</p>

<p>It is such moments as these that test master and men.
How both were equal to the emergency, let Chief Electrician
Joffry relate:</p>


<p>III&mdash;TWO HUNDRED FEET BENEATH THE
SEA</p>

<p>"Clutching the periscope table," he said, "the Commandant
faces this blow. He is a man whom nothing
disconcerts. He orders that all submerging tanks be
emptied. Several times he repeats the order to discharge
the water. But the compressed air is not powerful
enough to expel it, and we continue to sink. The hull
creaks all over, but especially astern, for the stern, by
reason of the angle at which we are going down, is sixty
feet lower and under a pressure of two atmospheres
greater than the bow. It is the steel heart of the <i>Monge</i>
that is groaning. We must have at least 180 or 200 feet
of water above us. Believing that this is the end, we
sing the 'Marseillaise.'"</p>

<p>Quartermaster Mahe says the electric batteries were
short-circuited by the crash and the inrush of water. The
turbines stopped at the moment the lights went out.</p>

<p>"But if we see nothing, we can hear," adds the brave
Mahe. "We hear everything, and every noise echoes like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
a knell: dull murmurs of surging water, nerve-wracking
falls of men and things; questions anxiously spoken, crash
of objects upon each other, sinister creakings of the hull
under the terrible and ever increasing pressure. The
smell of burning, the vile emanations of chlorine&mdash;forerunners
of asphyxia&mdash;are inhaled everywhere, and grip
our throats. Tango, the bob-tailed Arab dog, is stuck
somewhere between the boilers."</p>


<p>IV&mdash;THE SONG OF DEATH&mdash;FROM DOWN
BELOW</p>

<p>All at once in this antechamber of death there rises a
song! To the steel heart of the <i>Monge</i> the even more
highly tempered hearts of the French sailors are replying.
They are singing! If the plates are springing, these
hearts do not give way. Like their ancestors, the ancient
Gauls, they fear nothing; and they prove it by intoning
a hymn for France at 200 feet below the surface of the
ocean. Yes, in their half overturned, flooded cage which
threatens to crush like an eggshell, they sing! No audience
is theirs and, so far as they know, none will ever
know how they met their end. But no matter, it is for
themselves they sing, possessed by the sublime exaltation
that makes martyrs and heroes.</p>

<p>Groping about, they manage to make a lamp flash for
a few seconds. This reveals the full gravity of the situation,
for it shows the pointers of the manometers standing
still at their limit, proving that they are far below
the greatest depth permitted to the <i>Monge</i>.</p>

<p>Commandant Morillot's hand is upon the lever that
controls the lead ballast, his last resource, but he hesitates
to release it. If the leads be released the submarine will
rise to the surface, but must be captured at once, for she
will then be unable to submerge again. He looks at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
men in the fitful light of the flashing lamp, questioning
them with his eyes, as he thinks: If it is good to live it is
also good to die for one's country. Their silence responding
to his immobility expresses their acquiescence
in the sacrifice.</p>

<p>But at last, under the direction of the Commander, the
engineers get the turbines working again. The creaking
diminishes, then it ceases. Ensign Appell strikes a match
and holds it to the manometer. The pointer moves from
its maximum (135 feet).</p>

<p>"Courage!" he cries, "we are rising!"</p>

<p>Quick to the periscopes! Alas, one of them has gone,
and the other is blind!</p>

<p>Still they rise. Suddenly a crash above, and then another.
Four shells explode right overhead. They are at
the surface, and the Austrians are firing on them!</p>

<p>There is nothing for it but to submerge again, come
what may. Scarcely has the Commandant given the order
than a shell bursts right in the port periscope chamber,
tearing a great hole in the hull. This time nothing can
save the <i>Monge</i>. Only now does the captain let go the
lead ballast. Since his vessel is lost, he will profit by the
brief respite this lightening will give to save the crew.
After closing the water valves he orders the forward
hatchway opened and leads his men to it.</p>

<p>"Not that way, my boys," he says to those who take
the wrong direction, "this way. As soon as you get out,
leap overboard to show that the <i>Monge</i> is sinking and
stop the enemy's fire."</p>


<p>V&mdash;GOOD-BY TO THE "MONGE"</p>

<p>Flashes from a lighthouse on shore show the men leaping
overboard and the boat sinking lower and lower. The
Austrians have ceased their fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>"We marched forward singing the 'Marseillaise,'" said
Joffry, "and with a cry of 'Vive la France!' we jumped.
Then, nothing under our feet. Good-by <i>Monge</i>!"</p>

<p>We felt the shock of an explosion. The floating debris
of the deck helped us to swim. Twelve of us clung to a
floating gangway, swimming with our feet, for half an
hour. Quartermasters Morel and Goulard were missing.</p>

<p>At last boats from the enemy destroyers came and
picked us up.</p>

<p>And Morillot? He went down with the <i>Monge</i>. The
details of his end are uncertain, but it is not difficult to
reconstruct them. Joffry says: "He did not come up on
deck. He remained at his post. Very calmly he stood
watching the manometer reveal the gradual sinking of
the vessel under him. He was surely saying in his heart
'If only my men can get away in time!' He told the last
of us to hurry, and he helped us to find our way. What
he did when he saw us all safe I do not know, but it
seemed to me that the <i>Monge</i> sank more swiftly. He
might have opened the water ballast valves to make her
sink before the hand of the Boches could touch her.
That is undoubtedly what he did, but I did not see him,
nor did any one."</p>

<p>And Mahe, who was in the control chamber, says:
"The captain told us: 'Our poor <i>Monge</i> is lost, but you
have yet time. Come this way, my lads.' He opened the
door and added: 'Au revoir, and courage, my lads!' I
dared not tell him to come up with us, for I saw he had
made up his mind to die with his ship, as he had already
told some of us he would."</p>


<p>VI&mdash;THE LAST TORPEDO</p>

<p>The captain of the Austrian gunboat <i>Balaton</i> told the
survivors that he had delayed launching boats to pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
them up, because a torpedo had been fired at his boat
from the <i>Monge</i> as she went down. He believed that
Commandant Morillot, having seen all his men safely
overboard, had gone below alone and deliberately fired a
last torpedo. That is possible, or it may be that a torpedo
was accidentally discharged from the sinking boat.
Joffry spoke of feeling an explosion after getting into
the water.</p>

<p>In an order of the day published as soon as the facts
became known, Admiral the Duke of the Abruzzi paid
tribute to the "heroic sacrifice in which Lieut. Morillot
decided to remain on board his sinking boat," and added:
"To do honor to this deed of the purest marine valor,
his Majesty the King has deigned to confer upon him,
<i>motu proprio</i>, the gold medal for valor." This was the
first time this rare distinction had been conferred since
the war began. In transmitting this notice to the French
Admiral, Vice-Admiral Cutinelli-Rendina added:</p>

<p>"His memory will ever remain for us an object of admiration
and worship."</p>

<h2>ESCAPE OF THE RUSSIAN LEADER
OF THE "TERRIBLE DIVISION"</h2>

<p class="center"><i>True Story of How General Korniloff Escaped
Across Hungary</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Ivan Novikoff</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The story of how the famous Russian general, leader of the
"Terrible Division," was captured by the Austrians, and how he
escaped in an Austrian soldier's uniform, making his way right
across Hungary, for a distance of over three hundred miles,
until he regained the Russian lines. This is the first detailed
narrative of the general's feat, as it is told in the <i>Wide World
Magazine</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I&mdash;STORY OF THE DREADED GENERAL&mdash;THE
RUSSIAN TIGER</p>

<p>The Forty-eighth Infantry Division of the Russian
army had long been dreaded by the enemy. Their bravery
and dash, their grim and almost desperate courage,
had earned for them the name of the "Terrible Division."</p>

<p>Their leader was the redoubtable General Korniloff, a
man of iron will and heroic courage. He was a worthy
descendant of that other great Korniloff, whose dying
words, "Lord, bless Russia and the Czar, save the fleet
and Sebastopol!" are inscribed on his monument near
the Malakhoff Hill, where he fell in the great assault of
1855. A tiger to his enemies was Korniloff, but very
gentle where his own men were concerned, solicitous for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
their wants and comforts. Though they were among the
bravest fighters in the Russian army, their leader never
threw their lives away recklessly. As for him, they believed
him to bear a charmed life. "Korniloff" was their
war-cry, and they felt safe in his hands.</p>

<p>In those brave days when the Russians were attacking
in the Carpathians, in the spring of 1915, Korniloff's men
were ever foremost in the fighting. Mowed down repeatedly
by the German and Austrian guns, which defended
the ground yard by yard, they came back to the charge
again and again with a furious <i>élan</i>.</p>

<p>The way of the Russians was barred by a commanding
eminence held by two divisions of the enemy. From this
height the fire had been devastating and unceasing, and
the position seemed impregnable. Formidable defences
of barbed wire guarded all the approaches, and mines
and other murderous devices defied all their efforts to
take the stronghold.</p>

<p>But Korniloff determined to accomplish the almost superhuman
task. Deliberately he set about breaking down
the defences. Two regiments were assigned to the task.
Night by night they worked in as much secrecy as the
darkness afforded, pressing on under a withering fire until
at last the road was clear. Then they took the height
by a furious assault, and were masters of the position
that had galled them for so many months. Five thousand
men had defeated twelve times their number. The Austrian
general, with his staff, was taken prisoner, and when
he learned of the numbers which had opposed his big
army he broke down and wept with rage and grief.
"Korniloff is not a man," he said; "he is an elemental
force."</p>

<p>The Russians were now masters of this important
strategical position. The town of Ivla lay in front of
them, within reach of their guns, but it was strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
fortified; while in the neighbouring forests the enemy
was concentrating in great numbers. The fighting continued
with unabated fury.</p>

<p>It was in April, 1915, and the rugged slopes of the
Carpathian hills and mountains were brightened with the
new green shoots of the foliage, with the vivid splashes
made by broom and poppy, anemone, and other variegated
blooms.</p>

<p>The Austrian forces were receiving reinforcements
rapidly, and the Russian general and his division, in their
new position, were hard pressed. They were almost isolated,
practically surrounded by sixty thousand fresh
enemy troops. The Russians kept up a solid and heroic
defence, but the enemy gave them no rest. Soon Korniloff's
much-weakened force was in a desperate situation.
All their bravery and sacrifice had been unavailing; the
enemy was gradually gaining upon them.</p>

<p>Calm and self-possessed, General Korniloff viewed the
situation. "We are too feeble to resist any longer," he
told his officers; "we must attack." This was Korniloff's
method. He called his men together and explained how
things stood. A small force must attack the Austrians
and thus cover the retreat of the main body. He called
for volunteers, and from the serried ranks that presented
themselves formed a small detachment pledged to make
the supreme dash. It was a forlorn hope, this attack,
but it might save the rest of the division, which was otherwise
doomed to fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>


<p>II&mdash;MARCHING TO DEATH BEFORE THE
HOLY IKON</p>

<p>Early on a beautiful spring morning the resolute band
mustered, and were passed in a pathetic little review by
their valiant chief, who knew that he should look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
but few of those faces again. As they bowed devoutly
before the holy ikon raised above them, they cried, "For
God, St. Nicholas, and the Czar!" Then they shouldered
their rifles, and a moment later were on the move, headed
by the commander himself.</p>

<p>The man&oelig;uvre surprised the enemy, as it was intended
to do, but the advancing force was violently assailed by
a triple fire from artillery, rifles, and machine-guns. Still,
however, they stumbled on, singing a chant popular with
the peasants on the banks of the Volga. Man after man
fell around the intrepid Korniloff, but the survivors
pressed on unheeding; they knew that every yard they advanced
meant more chance for the Forty-eighth Division.</p>

<p>Steadily they ploughed their way onwards till they
were close to the enemy's lines. By this time there was
but a handful of them left. Korniloff himself was
wounded, and his strength was fast failing him.</p>

<p>The Austrians looked on with astonishment. Would
these madmen never surrender? The ground was strewn
with their dead and wounded. What could the last few
survivors hope to accomplish? At last a bullet brought
down the indomitable general, and the one-sided fight was
over.</p>


<p>III&mdash;THE GREAT KORNILOFF A PRISONER
OF THE AUSTRIANS</p>

<p>When Korniloff came to himself, and was able to take
account of his surroundings, he found himself in a hospital,
being treated for his serious wounds. He was a
prisoner of the Austrians, as were the few of his men who
had been left alive when he himself was taken. But he
breathed a sigh of relief, for the gallant Forty-eighth
Division had been saved by his devotion and the sacrifice
of his splendid little band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Dreary months of illness and convalescence passed by.
At last the general was well enough to be moved from the
hospital, and his captors conveyed him to a safer and more
suitable habitation. As a prisoner of mark, a residence
was chosen for him at the château of Esterhazy, at Eisenstadt,
in the Sopron Department in Hungary. This was
the famous castle, built in 1683, where Haydn was
<i>Kapell-meister</i> to the Prince Esterhazy of the time.</p>

<p>Korniloff made up his mind that Eisenstadt should
not long have him as a guest, and with increasing health
and strength he set about finding a means of escape.
First of all he made friends with the men who acted as
his guardians, and they were flattered at the notice taken
of them by the redoubtable Russian general, whose fame
had spread over the Empire. He took a great interest
in these common soldiers; he talked to them of their lives,
their homes, the fights they had been in; and learned from
them a few words and expressions in Magyar.</p>

<p>Now, one of these Austrian soldiers (as General Korniloff
afterwards related to the delegates of the Czech Brigade,
when they welcomed him in Kiev and congratulated
him on his escape) happened to be a Slovack. What
more natural than that he should sympathize with the prisoner
and agree to help him to regain his liberty? In exactly
what way he did this, no one knows save Korniloff
himself, and as regards such points he is naturally discretion
itself. Anyway, one morning, as he was returning to
his apartment from the park in which he was allowed to
stroll, he passed a guardroom, the door of which was
open. On a table just inside lay a private soldier's uniform,
with forage cap and everything complete. No one
was in sight, though he heard somewhere in the rear the
voices of men at their morning tasks. It was the work
of a second to slip in, snatch up the kit, hide it under his
cloak, and hasten to his own room. Had it been placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
there, by arrangement, by the Slovack? Presumably, considering
what followed next.</p>

<p>For two days after that the general kept to his apartment,
suffering from a fictitious cold. He feared that
inquiries might be made as to the missing garments, but
to his heartfelt relief he heard nothing further about the
matter. As there was always a considerable coming and
going of soldiers, he trusted that during the two days he
remained invisible there might be some new arrivals who
would not be familiar with his person when the time came
for action.</p>


<p>IV&mdash;STORY OF KORNILOFF'S DARING
ESCAPE</p>

<p>On the second evening Korniloff, who had already experimented
with the borrowed uniform and found that it
fitted him fairly well, dressed himself in it and shaved off
his beard. For some time past he had practised to himself
before a mirror his knowledge of the German language,
which was fairly good, and its pronunciation with
the soft Austrian accent.</p>

<p>At nightfall, arrayed in his disguise, he went down into
the courtyard and across into the park, where, at a certain
spot and hour, he had arranged to meet his Slovack
friend.</p>

<p>Here he hung about near the gate for some time, talking
to soldiers, smoking a cigar, and cursing in the best
military slang. Nobody suspected him, and at a moment
when the sentinel's back was turned he slipped out. At
first he strolled along nonchalantly, hoping that if he had
been observed the others would think he was only one of
themselves going off for a spree without leave. As soon
as he was out of sight, however, the general "put his best
leg foremost" and made the utmost haste he could towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
a figure which he recognized to be that of the man
who had promised to guide him towards Russia. They
had provided themselves with a map and compass, and
had also accumulated a little store of money. But Russia
was a long way off, and their plans for the future were
somewhat vague.</p>

<p>All that night and most of the next day Korniloff and
his unknown friend (the general confessed that he never
knew the name of his benefactor) walked in an easterly
direction. They slept for some hours in a lonely field,
and then got on the move again. Here and there peasants
helped them on their way; they were offered food and
drink and a rest. Though they avoided small towns,
they were making their way to Budapest, thinking that
something might happen in that great city to help them,
and that they could easily pass unchallenged where so
many races intermingled.</p>

<p>But before reaching the great city on the banks of the
blue Danube an unexpected and most unhappy incident
occurred. The plan of escape was almost entirely
wrecked.</p>

<p>"We had noticed that wherever we went the gendarmes
eyed us suspiciously," said the general to the already
mentioned delegation. "In every village through which
we passed, at every farm at which we called for bite or
sup, on every plain which we crossed, there seemed to be
eyes watching us. Soon our provisions became exhausted
and we began to suffer the pangs of hunger. One day,
after a long, hungry march, my Slovack guide&mdash;the faithful
companion of the early part of my sufferings&mdash;decided,
since he was on the point of exhaustion, to ask for
food and water at an isolated farm. I warned him that
it was dangerous, but hardly had the words passed my
lips than he was gone. I saw him enter the farm and
waited in vain&mdash;waited for ten long hours! At last I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
comprehended what had happened. I saw the gendarmes
surround the house and heard the sound of gunshots.
Flight, instant flight, was the only course open to me,
and thus, alone for the remainder of my journey, I continued
with all speed towards Budapest."</p>


<p>V&mdash;THE RUSSIAN GENERAL DISGUISED AS
AN AUSTRIAN</p>

<p>On reaching the Hungarian city, General Korniloff
found it, as he expected, full of troops. Reinforcements
were coming in to be dispatched to the various fronts,
while other men were on their way home on periods of
furlough. Amid all these soldiers nobody took any notice
of the disguised Russian in his simple Austrian uniform.
Needless to say, he carefully avoided attracting attention
to himself, always keeping where the crowds were thickest.</p>

<p>Feeling hungry, he went into a small eating-house frequented
by working-class people and ordered beer, bread,
and sausage. Most of the customers in the place spoke
Hungarian, but two sitting at a table near him were talking
in German, and he overheard what they said. One of
them was a woman, who, to judge by her appearance,
was engaged in munition-making.</p>

<p>"<i>Ach, du Guter!</i>" she exclaimed to her companion.
"That Russian general they captured in the Carpathians
last year&mdash;Korniloff&mdash;has escaped, and they are offering
a reward for his capture."</p>

<p>The fugitive felt for a moment as if all eyes were bent
upon him, but as a matter of fact nobody took any notice
of him.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" growled the man addressed. "Why couldn't
they keep him when they had him? How much are they
offering?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fifty thousand kronen."</p>

<p>"<i>Fui tausend!</i> Fifty thousand kronen for a <i>verdammten
Russen</i>! And in these times, when the war costs so
much!"</p>

<p>"<i>Ja, mein lieber</i>, but he's a general, you see," explained
the woman. "I wish I could find him. It would be better
than making munitions."</p>

<p>So there was a price of fifty thousand kronen on his
head, reflected Korniloff, as he left the restaurant. He
felt strangely elated at the thought that he was calmly
passing among the enemy unknown and unsuspected with
such a reward offered for his capture. He bought a
newspaper to obtain confirmation of the woman's announcement,
and there he found the notice in large type,
with a curiously inaccurate portrait of himself.</p>

<p>The darkness was now falling, and he walked on until
he found himself in the Franz Josefplatz. A large number
of soldiers were camping in the square, lying upon
the benches or on the ground, and evidently preparing to
spend the night there. Artillery-wagons were lined up all
round. A man he passed&mdash;an Austrian artillery man&mdash;looked
up at him and smiled. He was fixing his haversack
against the trunk of a tree to serve as a sort of pillow.</p>

<p>"As good here as anywhere else," said the man in German.</p>

<p>"To be sure," Korniloff replied. "Better than the
trenches, anyway. Why is the regiment bivouacking
here?"</p>

<p>"No room elsewhere, comrade," said the soldier.
"Wounded and soldiers everywhere&mdash;all the barracks
full; everything full. Well, it's a nice night. Have a
smoke?"</p>

<p>He offered a cigar, which the disguised general accepted,
sitting down beside his new-found friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where have you come from, and where are you going?"
asked the Austrian.</p>

<p>"Rejoining my regiment after convalescence," replied
Korniloff.</p>

<p>They sat and exchanged confidence for some time, the
Austrian asking numerous questions which Korniloff parried
as well as he could. The gunner confessed that he
was heartily sick of the war, as were all his comrades.
He heard nothing but complaints from his home, where
conditions were getting harder and food was becoming
scarcer.</p>

<p>"It's the same with you, eh, comrade?" he said. "I
don't suppose you come from a part of the world that's
any better off?"</p>

<p>The Austrian was a simple soul, and he told Korniloff
many things that interested him. Finally, after he had
babbled in this way for some time, both men fell asleep
side by side.</p>


<p>VI&mdash;TRAMPING ACROSS HUNGARY WITH
THE PEASANTS</p>

<p>Korniloff bade his chance host good-bye and was off on
his journey again before the regiment was stirring. He
decided that he must trust to his feet. He would march
right across Hungary; and by means of his map and compass
he hoped to make so straight a line that it would not
take him more than a month. He was now in good health
and in excellent trim generally, and he had no fear of the
journey if he could only get enough food to keep him
alive. He must not linger on the way, however, for every
hour was now of importance to him.</p>

<p>Having taken a crust and a cup of coffee at a wayside
tavern full of soldiers, he got out of the city while the
day was still young. Then began a long and dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
tramp, mostly alone, for the peasants in this region were
not communicative, for the simple reason that he could
not speak their language. He tramped for whole days
without passing anything bigger than small hamlets, and
his conversation was limited to asking, most frequently
at farmhouses, for <i>kruh</i> (bread) or <i>viz</i> (water).</p>

<p>Sometimes the peasants would look him up and down
and ask him, "<i>Osztrak?</i>" ("Austrian?"), and he would
nod his head.</p>

<p>Very rarely did he get anything without paying for it,
and as he saw his small stock of heller gradually disappearing,
he had to be as economical as possible with those
that remained. He slept mostly in the open air, since the
weather was fine and there was little danger; once he was
given a "shake-down" in a loft, and once he paid a few
heller for a bed at a country inn.</p>

<p>Eventually Korniloff was reduced to almost his last
pieces of money, and he felt that he must husband these
in case of a very pressing need. A day came when he got
nothing to eat but some wild strawberries picked by the
roadside. A woman whom he asked for a bit of bread
chased him away from her door with an oath, calling him
"<i>Verdammten Osztrak!</i>" The next morning he got some
bread, but again a day passed with no food but wild berries
and water from a brook.</p>

<p>Things were getting worse and worse, but Korniloff
knew he was near the end of his journey, and would be
safe in another three or four days if only he could hold
out. He had now been walking for nearly twenty days.</p>


<p>VII&mdash;"HALT!"&mdash;HE SALUTES A GERMAN
CAPTAIN</p>

<p>One of his narrowest escapes happened in the little
town of Klausenburg, a quiet place ordinarily, but now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the centre of great military activity. He was walking
through the town, as it was the best way of keeping to the
direct route. Suddenly, from behind him, he heard a
harsh voice cry in German, "<i>Halte!</i>"</p>

<p>Looking round, he saw that it was he himself who was
being addressed. He halted; there was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>"Why did you not stop and salute me?" asked an offensive-looking
young Austrian officer.</p>

<p>Korniloff clinked his heels together and saluted.</p>

<p>"I did not see you, Herr Hauptmann!"</p>

<p>"Ah! you are blind, then? Who are you, and where
are you going?"</p>

<p>"Johann Bach," said the Russian, affecting simplicity,
"and I am going home to my wife."</p>

<p>"You will come with me first, so that we can make a
few inquiries about you."</p>

<p>Disaster stared the fugitive in the face. His first impulse
was to run, but he resisted it. To obey, however,
would mean his immediate discovery.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, gracious Herr Captain," he said,
as humbly as he could, though inwardly cursing. "I beg
you not to detain me now, when I am so anxious to get
to my dear wife."</p>

<p>"An hour longer from your wife won't hurt you," answered
the officer. "Come with me."</p>

<p>His tone was so utterly offensive that, almost instinctively,
Korniloff made a gesture of defiance. Quickly the
officer called two men who were passing. "Take this
man to the Kiraly barracks," he ordered. "I will meet
you there in half an hour."</p>

<p>The two soldiers saluted, placed themselves on either
side of Korniloff, and marched him off. He knew it
was no good trying to escape, so he thought he would try
friendliness. "Give me at least a smoke," he said; and
very willing one of the men stopped, gave him a cigar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and lighted it. They asked him what he had done, or
not done, to bring on himself this disciplinary measure.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only because I don't know the way," said
Korniloff. "Come and have a drink with me, comrades.
There is no harm in that."</p>


<p>VIII&mdash;STORY OF A GIRL AND A SHEPHERD'S
HUT</p>

<p>One soldier looked at the other, and they nodded&mdash;it
was not far to the barracks&mdash;and then turned into a small
beer-garden, where drinks were ordered. They were
served by a comely young woman, who looked with interest
at the captive, for soldiers are not reticent in talking
to the opposite sex. Korniloff did not know how it
came about, but presently his companions, who took a
second glass of beer, began to feel the effects in a way that
he would never have expected. Korniloff left the table with
an excuse to his comrades, who paid little attention.</p>

<p>The girl, who had been watching him, beckoned to him
from the side of the house, grasped his arm, and led him
to the yard.</p>

<p>"Flee," she said, "across those fields. I will keep them
in talk. I have put something in their beer. Flee!" she
repeated, and thrust a piece of bread and meat into his
hand.</p>

<p>By way of answer Korniloff seized her hand, kissed
her, turned on his heel, and hastened away as quickly as
he could. In a very short while the town of Klausenburg
was miles behind him. He walked almost all
through the night, fearful that a hue and cry might be
raised.</p>

<p>The next day the general felt a new sympathy, as it
were, in the air. This was Transylvania, where he would
run much less risk of being discovered. He had seen a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
newspaper at the inn at Klausenburg which told him great
news&mdash;that Roumania was on the point of joining the Allies.</p>

<p>He stopped two peasants and asked them where he was.
They pointed out the directions of Russia and of Moldavai.</p>

<p>"You're a Russian," said one the peasants, speaking
in a dialect known in the Bukovina.</p>

<p>Korniloff nodded, waiting to see what the result might
be, but his confession evidently evoked sympathy.</p>

<p>"See!" said the man, taking him by the arm. "Follow
yonder brook, cross the hill as straight as you can, and
to-night you will find a shepherd's hut on the right of the
road at the bottom of the hill. Go there and ask for
Mathias Meltzer; he will help you."</p>

<p>With a cheery "good day" they left him, and Korniloff
trudged on. After a stiff day's march he reached the hut
and found the old shepherd, with a younger man. Korniloff
repeated the message he had been told to give.</p>

<p>"And who are you? An escaped Russian?" asked the
old man as he sat beside his wood fire and shaded his
hand to look at the stranger. "The Russian outposts are
half a day's march from here," he continued. "I often
hear the guns. To-morrow the Roumanians come in on
the side of the Allies. Soon the Russians and the Roumanians
will join hands and all this land will be laid
waste."</p>

<p>"Will you take me to the Russians?" asked Korniloff.
"It will be worth your while."</p>

<p>The old man pondered for a time. "I don't mind helping
a Russian," he said, at last. "They've always been
decent to me. Lie you down now and get some sleep, for
we must start before daybreak."</p>

<p>He handed his guest a little bread, coarse cheese, and
some onions. Korniloff made a meal and was soon asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>They started on their journey next morning in wet
and mist. Mathias covered the Russian with a discoloured
piece of sackcloth to make him look like a shepherd,
in case they met inquisitive strangers. They kept
close to the bed of a river and a small forest, and, creeping
forward stealthily, were by midday in sight of the
Russian outposts.</p>

<p>Here Korniloff was safe with his own people, and
great was their joy when they learned who he was. A
few days later the general was able to send a trusty messenger
to the shepherd, Mathias Meltzer, carrying a sum
of money and a letter of thanks to tell him whom he had
saved.</p>


<p>IX&mdash;SEQUEL: A SLOVACK SOLDIER AND A
HANGMAN</p>

<p>The sequel to this stirring story remains to be told.
Who was the noble Slovack soldier&mdash;true to his race and
his duty towards a Slav in trouble&mdash;who assisted General
Korniloff to escape, and what was his ultimate fate? For
three months nothing was known. Only recently was the
author of these lines able to read in the Hungarian papers
the account of a court-martial, held at Presburg, which
had condemned to death by hanging "a Slovack soldier,
named Francis Mornyak, proved to have been guilty of
having assisted General Korniloff to escape from the
château of Esterhazy." The execution of this obscure
hero took place immediately after the judgment.</p>

<h2>THE AERIAL ATTACK ON
RAVENNA</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Told by Paolo Poletti</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In <i>L'lllustrasione Italiana</i> this distinguished Italian author expresses
his indignation at the bombardment of Ravenna by
Austrian aviators, when the ancient Basilica of Sant' Apollinare
narrowly escaped destruction. Translated for <i>Current History</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>I write with a feeling of relief. My beautiful Sant'
Apollinare is uninjured, or nearly so. A blind bomb may
have furrowed the April sky of my city, in this marvellous
foretaste of Spring; but the criminal attempt has
been in vain. And, with me, innumerable citizens of
Ravenna have breathed a sigh almost of content. It is
true that there were human victims. But our pity for
them is too deep for any comment to be adequate; the
only way to commemorate them worthily is to avenge
them. But it is not of this wrong we wish to speak to-day.
We wish only to bring together and to distill into a
brief comment the living essence of the spirit of Ravenna,
as it has affirmed itself in this historic, solemn hour.</p>

<p>The people of Ravenna have felt a lightning flash of
sudden revolt because of the outrage perpetrated on their
monuments. The citizens of Ravenna, if they have not,
for the antique glories of their city, the fully conscious
veneration which we shall hardly expect to find among
them, nevertheless do breathe in from these monuments
a deep impression of exaltation and well-founded pride.
Our readers will remember those "Monologues" which
Gigi Easi wrote with such grace and such penetrating
humour. In one, "The Art of Delivering a Monologue,"
he introduces as speakers the inhabitants of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
capital cities of Italy, each of whom magnifies the beauty
of his own city.</p>

<p>So it happens that, along with the Florentine, the
Neapolitan, the Venetian, and the rest, there is not lacking
a good citizen of Ravenna who, with vibrant words
and potent adjectives, in intense and enthusiastic exaltation,
energetically affirms the supremacy of his mosaics
and his basilicas. The scene is not only most exhilarating,
but also, from the point of view of psychology,
profoundly true. Our populace lives, and feels that it
lives, with its mighty memories and with its great historic
personages, whose moral significance at least it knows
how to estimate, and whose remoter glory it understands
by a kind of natural and traditional intuition, and respects
it, I might almost say, by a distant residuum of
atavistic suggestion.</p>

<p>Galla, daughter and sister of Emperors; Theodoric
sleeping, sleeping, according to these humble fancies, a
secular sleep under his heavy monolith; Justinian, up-raiser
of precious churches and reviser of the imperial
idea and the laws of Rome; Theodora, the dancing girl
become a Queen, speak a language incomprehensible to
the rough minds of our people, yet a secret fascination
emanates to them from the rich vaults, heavy with gold,
of the antique basilicas; from those vaulted roofs toward
which, in their time, rose the thunderous hosannas of
triumphal victories, and the humble supplications of
tragical misfortunes; those vaulted domes, dazzling with
emerald and ruby, to which were raised hands wrung in
despair and menace, or joined in the lowly adoration of
prayer; toward which were raised foreheads tormented
with gnawing hatred or consoled by illuminating
love....</p>

<p>The basilica of Theodoric, made the target of the
iniquitous attempt of the Barbarians, ever speaks to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
people in the mysterious tongue of days long gone....</p>

<p>Oh, my beautiful Sant' Apollinare! we dreaded to see
shattered thy gleaming mosaics; we dreaded to see cut in
two and mutilated thy ten-centuries-old campanile, which
sends forth joyful peals in the luminous evenings of
May; we feared that the voice would be stilled, which
arises from thee, to chant a profound poem of history
and of art.</p>

<p>We recall your founder, Theodoric, and his reign in
Ravenna; his wise and successful attempt to bring together
in peaceful relations the conquerors and the conquered,
engrafting into the ultimate stem of Latin civilization
the young shoot of fresh barbaric energy; so
that his terrible invasion did not interrupt the continuity
of history, but proceeded to develop harmoniously in the
integration of the old Roman elements with the new,
blended in a single composed form of enduring life.</p>

<p>Of the art which reminds us, through the verses of
Gabriel d'Annunzio, of the millenary of Ravenna, one
might also speak of the "Purple night, gleaming with
gold"; of the Virgins of Sant' Apollinare, in Francesca's
passionate speech:</p>

<p>"The Virgins of Sant' Apollinare burn not so bright in
their heaven of gold"; and the prophecy:</p>

<p>"Oh, Prisca, another hero will draw the bow from thy
desert toward the infinite.... Clad in armour, he
awaits the new days; thy warrior awaits the certain
dawn, when a voice through the desert paths shall call
forth the ancestral valour!"</p>

<p>We fit the augury to the new times; and, to meet the
new Barbarians, we invoke the sacred vengeance of Italy
here, from this furthest bourne of our Garibaldian land!</p>
